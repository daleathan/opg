2 CONT Letter written 3/10/05
2 CONT 
2 CONT Hi Darcy.  Thanks for writing.
2 CONT Here's the relationship.
2 CONT 
2 CONT My maternal grandmorther was Belle Brown Reiner.  Her sister was Lena Bro
2 CONC wn Rosenberg.  Lena was Ginny's grandmother.  So my mother, Blanche Reine
2 CONC r Ames was a first cousin to Ginny's mother, Edith Rosenberg Riedelbach
2 CONC .  I knew Lena, and her other children and grandchildren, when I was grow
2 CONC ing up in L.A. in the 1940's and 50's.  I didn't know Edith or her childr
2 CONC en at all because she moved away before I was born.
2 CONT 
2 CONT So Ginny and I are second cousins, and if you are her daughter or daughte
2 CONC r-in-law, we're second cousins once removed
2 CONC .  
2 CONT 
2 CONT Edith was one of the few cousins of my mother's generation who didn't rem
2 CONC ain Jewish, and her children grew up with little exposure to their Jewis
2 CONC h heritage.  Similarly, most of the other  cousins I'm in contact with re
2 CONC main unaware of our Christian cousins descended from Edith.  It is fascin
2 CONC ating to me how much cultural divergence there can be in just a couple o
2 CONC f generations.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I am not a devout Jew, although many of my cousins are.  I feel I am cult
2 CONC urally Jewish, but I am not a religious person.
2 CONT 
2 CONT You have a good point about schools being used as an arena for certain ki
2 CONC nds of teaching.  This brings up questions about what are appropriate sub
2 CONC jects.  How do you feel about teaching creationism in schools?
2 CONT 
2 CONT Are you going to be in Monterey in June?
2 CONT 
2 CONT --Jody

2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: Patriarchal blessing of Sr. Emma Smith Kennedy, given at Indep

2 CONT 
2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: 	Daughter Emma, in Jesus name I lay my hands upon thee to bles
2 CONC s thee, and through knowing well the love of a Father's heart and how tha
2 CONC t love would reach out and protect thee from harm and from harmful influe
2 CONC nces, and how the father's heart bleeds when he sees thee suffering, an
2 CONC d how he would gladly give of His strength to make thee strong and well
2 CONC , I bless thee in the name of the Lord Jesus and ask God in this blessin
2 CONC g that He will come to thee and give thee strength, that He may rebuke th
2 CONC e adversary of life, that He shall be rebuked in the presence of His Divi
2 CONC ne Spirit, and that He will bring thee that health so necessary to thee i
2 CONC n the circumstances of life that thou art placed, that as God has given t
2 CONC hee a little one so bright, so loving, so trustful, that thou mayest be g
2 CONC iven strength and life to rear that little one in the love and in the adm
2 CONC onition of the Lord, that his life, through thee, may be so formed, so or
2 CONC ganized, so educated that He may become a bright and polished shaft in th
2 CONC e hands of the Master of doing good to His fellows. I pray that God may g
2 CONC ive thee this life, this strength, this health, that thou mayst live to t
2 CONC his end, to fulfill the mission of thy being and rear to manhood the chil
2 CONC d God has given thee, to be a companion to him whom thou hast chosen wit
2 CONC h whom to walk in life, to be a strength to him, that his faith my not wa
2 CONC ver nor falter nor be turned aside, that He may see in you and feeling i
2 CONC n you the influence of good leading him to a better life, a higher an
2 CONC d a nobler existence. I pray that God may bless thee, may lay thy life li
2 CONC nes in pleasant places. The trials of the past have but been of the natur
2 CONC e that is they have been rightly received by thee will make thee wise an
2 CONC d enable thee to order thy life differently in the days that are promise
2 CONC d thee, and enable thee to correct the mistakes which have been made in t
2 CONC he past.
2 CONT 	I see for thee the influences of good urging thee on, and the efforts th
2 CONC ou hast made in the past in this direction have been accepted of God. Whe
2 CONC n thou hast been cast down, when thou hast been grieved, for tried thou h
2 CONC as been, thou hast tried though thou hast not been strong enough, to do t
2 CONC hat thou hast desired to do, but God has been willing to accept the effor
2 CONC t and to give thee the reward.  I pray that His divine Spirit may be wit
2 CONC h thee in the future, that in the effort to improve the opportunities tha
2 CONC t may be granted thee, thou canned prove thyself worthy the recognition o
2 CONC f God. He will give to thee the evidences of His Divine Spirit that wil
2 CONC l lead thee along life's pathway though thou mast be called to pass mids
2 CONC t the shadows of life, still there is brightness for thee, there is happi
2 CONC ness and joy and contentment in God's will.
2 CONT 	Be faithful. Suffer thy faith not to be shaken. Trust in God; put not yo
2 CONC ur trust in the arm of flesh, neither trust what man can do, but trust i
2 CONC n God and whatever His  providences shall be unto thee, remember that th
2 CONC e promise is, "Thou shalt be redeemed," Thou art recognized as a child o
2 CONC f God and thou shalt be brought through the trials of life, and receive h
2 CONC onor and glory in the Kingdom of God.
2 CONT 	Thou art of Israel in a two fold sense. Israel by reason of the laws o
2 CONC f adoption. Israel by descent. Thou camest of the line of prophets, eve
2 CONC n the Joseph that was sold into Egypt, and thou art recognized of God a
2 CONC s precious in his sight. Remember this and let thy heart be comforted, an
2 CONC d the trials of life that are allotted thee are given by design and not b
2 CONC y chance. If thou art able to bear patiently the pains and the trials, th
2 CONC ou shalt come off conqueror, yea, more than conqueror, even redeemed, an
2 CONC d enter into the joys of the ransomed and redeemed. The promise of Eterna
2 CONC l Life is think, and thou shalt receive it, but be faithful. Be not weari
2 CONC ed. Be not deceived, but lead a life of purity that the Divine Spirit ins
2 CONC pires thee to lead.
2 CONT 	The inspiration of God shall come to thee and give thee visions of brigh
2 CONC tness that shall comfort thee. Thou shalt be enabled to see and understan
2 CONC d spiritual things; things that to others are mysteries shall be plain an
2 CONC d easy for thee, and thou shalt be enabled to contemplate these things an
2 CONC d think upon them and receive wisdom and knowledge and light therefrom.
2 CONT 	Thou comest from a family and of a family that has been permitted to se
2 CONC e the visions of eternity, having been open to thy progenitor's and havin
2 CONC g been enabled to see them. And there is no good reason why thou shoulds
2 CONC t not also see these things and in thy lot in life's sphere and calling o
2 CONC f life whereunto thou art called thou mast do good by reason of these evi
2 CONC dences and presence of the divine Spirit.
2 CONT 	Now I bid thee be consoled and be cheered and comforted. Rejoice. Do no
2 CONC t murmur. Do not complain. Be content and the will of God being served i
2 CONC n thee, thou shalt be elevated and glorified in His celestial Kingdom. Da
2 CONC ughter, I seal these blessing upon thee in the name of the Lord Jesus. Am
2 CONC en.

1 NOTE The following is a letter to Darcy Kennedy July 7, 2005 from Gracia Norma
2 CONC ndeau Jones.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "Darcy, as I look at the family of Don Alvin, son of Alexander, do you se
2 CONC e Marion Don? That name ought to be Don Marion
2 CONT  
2 CONT Max was only a year old when his father died. As I recall, Grandmother El
2 CONC izabeth Agnes Kendall helped take care of this family. My mother had a le
2 CONC tter from Don Alvin's wife, about the time that my sister Jeannette was b
2 CONC orn. In the old fashioned writing, she thought her name was Jeannette, s
2 CONC o she named my sister after her. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Genie Graham can probably tell us for sure on the name Don Marion, bu
2 CONC t I am sure it was a mistake on Audentia's part putting it in the book a
2 CONC s Marion Don. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Don Alvin died in 1901, when his little children were so young. Their mot
2 CONC her worked in the book bindery for the herald in Lamoni and Grandma Lizzi
2 CONC e watched the children. Lizzie died in 1918. She also had care of Arthu
2 CONC r Marion's first family after his first wife died in child birth in 1816
2 CONC , Lizzie also took on that family. I think she wore out because she die
2 CONC d in 1819 poor thing. Lizzie was already caring for Eva Grace's son, afte
2 CONC r Eva died in child birth...
2 CONT that is Judi Madison's line.

2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: Brother Frederick,
2 CONT 	In the name of the Lord Jesus I lay my hands upon thee that thou mayes
2 CONC t receive such help, light, strength, and divine direction, as will quali
2 CONC fy thee not only to be a true and faithful member of the church of God, b
2 CONC ut to fulfill the high and important duties belonging to thy office and c
2 CONC alling.  To the end that thou mayest discharge the duties that devolve up
2 CONC on thee in a manner that will bring satisfaction to thyself and appreciat
2 CONC ion by the people of the church for the work done, I bless thee, that tho
2 CONC u mayest indeed enjoy the spirit and office of thy calling.
2 CONT 	As thou knowest, thou hast been called to a high and important position
2 CONC , standing now with the leaders of the church of God. Thou art able, an
2 CONC d if humble and faithful, thou wilt continue to be able to accomplish a g
2 CONC ood work, and, at times, to bring to bear a corrective influence, even wi
2 CONC th those who stand high in authority, because we all have our limitations
2 CONC , we all have our weaknesses, and we are commanded to teach one another
2 CONC , and to teach diligently, that God's grace may attend us. Seek to obey t
2 CONC his commandment, dear brother, and the grace of god and the power of Hi
2 CONC s Spirit shall be with thee.
2 CONT 	Thou hast started well. Remain humble. Do not trust too much to thysel
2 CONC f at any time. Be carefully guarded in this respect, for it is always nee
2 CONC dful that our wisdom should be supplemented with the wisdom of God, and a
2 CONC s Jesus said, it is verily true, "Without me ye can do nothing." Therefor
2 CONC e, continue to put thy trust in God, and whatever thou seest to be thy du
2 CONC ty and privilege belonging to thy office and calling, discharge it in th
2 CONC e fear of God, without regard to what others may think and thou shalt b
2 CONC e blessed in thy work, the comfort and light of the Spirit will attend th
2 CONC ee, divine direction will be given, from time to time, and needed wisdom
2 CONC , if thou wilt learn to properly cooperate with God. But, dear brother, t
2 CONC here will be trials and conflicts, and some times disappointments. Do no
2 CONC t fear because of this, for all power is in the hands of God. Remember th
2 CONC at the Lord Jesus was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and th
2 CONC e servant is not above his lord.
2 CONT 	Sometimes thou wilt see things which will bring sorrow and grief to th
2 CONC y soul, but I bid thee to not permit anything to interfere with the hig
2 CONC h and important duties of thy calling in the church of God. May the Spiri
2 CONC t belonging to thy calling ever be with thee. To this end I bless thee i
2 CONC n the name of the Lord Jesus. And as thou art required to instruct and te
2 CONC ach others the great principles of the divine plan, remember that all cen
2 CONC ters in Jesus Christ, the great head of the church. He has truly said, "
2 CONC I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man can come unto the Father ex
2 CONC cept by me."  Emphasize this great truth in thy teaching and the Lord wil
2 CONC l bless thee, thy mind will expand, thy tongue shall be unloosed to decla
2 CONC re the great truths of the divine plan, and from time to time they will m
2 CONC ove the souls of men for good–those who are seeking after the truth.
2 CONT 	Now I bless thee that thou mayest have proper discernment, so that whe
2 CONC n needful thou canst decide quickly between darkness and light, truth an
2 CONC d error, wrong and right, in order that thou mayest be more useful in th
2 CONC e hands of God, and bring no reproach upon His glorious cause.
2 CONT 	I accept thee, dear brother, as one of the sons of Ephraim, with whom th
2 CONC ou art properly numbered, and bless thee that thou mayest be able to se
2 CONC t an example in harmony with thy teaching; that under the influences of t
2 CONC he Divine Spirit thou mayest be able to look back over thy life, and loo
2 CONC k at thyself as thou art now, and understand where thy weak points are, a
2 CONC nd what needs to be corrected and strengthened, and what needs to be remo
2 CONC ved. I bless thee to this end. May the light of God's Spirit and His hel
2 CONC p be graciously afforded, from time to time, that thou mayest become a wo
2 CONC rkman that needeth not to be ashamed in very deed, in this office to whic
2 CONC h thou art now called, and in the discharge of thy duty, God will stand b
2 CONC y thee, and He will never forsake thee when the time of weakness and tria
2 CONC l shall come; but the peculiar conditions will sometimes arise, somewha
2 CONC t unexpected, for which I bid the to be as well prepared as possible in o
2 CONC rder that they may do thee no harm
2 CONC . 
2 CONT 	In thy day thou shalt see many who have embraced the truth fall upon th
2 CONC e right and upon the left, because of unbelief and unfaithfulness; but th
2 CONC ou shalt also see the faithful and true drawing nearer and nearer to God
2 CONC , and thou wilt be able to recognize that in all thy efforts–feeble thoug
2 CONC h thou mayest feel that they are, especially at times– that God has quali
2 CONC fied thee to bless the people and help them to draw nearer to God, and s
2 CONC o thou wilt be encouraged to press forward and accomplish the work whic
2 CONC h has been given thee to do.
2 CONT 	Now dear brother, remain humble and continue thy work faithfully and wel
2 CONC l, for I tell thee, that if faithful, here is the work of thy life. Do no
2 CONC t think of anything else; but give thy whole life to this office and call
2 CONC ing, and the Lord will bless thee and bless many others through thy work
2 CONC , and thus great good shall come to the people of God. May the light of H
2 CONC is Spirit and its comforting influence, to encourage and bless from tim
2 CONC e to time, be granted, and I say to thee, that with a reasonable effort u
2 CONC pon thy part thou shalt overcome, and finally rest in the presence of Go
2 CONC d and Christ and loved ones in the enjoyment of celestial reward. I sea
2 CONC l these blessings upon thee in the name of thy Lord and thy Redeemer. Ame

2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: Brother Frederick,
2 CONT 	In the name of the Lord Jesus I lay my hands upon thee that thou mayes
2 CONC t receive such help, light, strength, and divine direction, as will quali
2 CONC fy thee not only to be a true and faithful member of the church of God, b
2 CONC ut to fulfill the high and important duties belonging to thy office and c

2 CONC on thee in a manner that will bring satisfaction to thyself and appreciat
2 CONC ion by the people of the church for the work done, I bless thee, that tho
2 CONC u mayest indeed enjoy the spirit and office of thy calling.
2 CONT 	As thou knowest, thou hast been called to a high and important position
2 CONC , standing now with the leaders of the church of God. Thou art able, an
2 CONC d if humble and faithful, thou wilt continue to be able to accomplish a g
2 CONC ood work, and, at times, to bring to bear a corrective influence, even wi
2 CONC th those who stand high in authority, because we all have our limitations
2 CONC , we all have our weaknesses, and we are commanded to teach one another
2 CONC , and to teach diligently, that God's grace may attend us. Seek to obey t
2 CONC his commandment, dear brother, and the grace of god and the power of Hi
2 CONC s Spirit shall be with thee.
2 CONT 	Thou hast started well. Remain humble. Do not trust too much to thysel
2 CONC f at any time. Be carefully guarded in this respect, for it is always nee
2 CONC dful that our wisdom should be supplemented with the wisdom of God, and a
2 CONC s Jesus said, it is verily true, "Without me ye can do nothing." Therefor
2 CONC e, continue to put thy trust in God, and whatever thou seest to be thy du
2 CONC ty and privilege belonging to thy office and calling, discharge it in th
2 CONC e fear of God, without regard to what others may think and thou shalt b
2 CONC e blessed in thy work, the comfort and light of the Spirit will attend th
2 CONC ee, divine direction will be given, from time to time, and needed wisdom
2 CONC , if thou wilt learn to properly cooperate with God. But, dear brother, t
2 CONC here will be trials and conflicts, and some times disappointments. Do no
2 CONC t fear because of this, for all power is in the hands of God. Remember th
2 CONC at the Lord Jesus was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and th
2 CONC e servant is not above his lord.
2 CONT 	Sometimes thou wilt see things which will bring sorrow and grief to th
2 CONC y soul, but I bid thee to not permit anything to interfere with the hig
2 CONC h and important duties of thy calling in the church of God. May the Spiri
2 CONC t belonging to thy calling ever be with thee. To this end I bless thee i
2 CONC n the name of the Lord Jesus. And as thou art required to instruct and te
2 CONC ach others the great principles of the divine plan, remember that all cen
2 CONC ters in Jesus Christ, the great head of the church. He has truly said, "
2 CONC I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man can come unto the Father ex

2 CONT 	Now I bless thee that thou mayest have proper discernment, so that whe
2 CONC n needful thou canst decide quickly between darkness and light, truth an
2 CONC d error, wrong and right, in order that thou mayest be more useful in th
2 CONC e hands of God, and bring no reproach upon His glorious cause.
2 CONT 	I accept thee, dear brother, as one of the sons of Ephraim, with whom th

2 CONC , if thou wilt learn to properly cooperate with God. But, dear brother, t
2 CONC here will be trials and conflicts, and some times disappointments. Do no
2 CONC t fear because of this, for all power is in the hands of God. Remember th
2 CONC at the Lord Jesus was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and th
2 CONC e servant is not above his lord.
2 CONT 	Sometimes thou wilt see things which will bring sorrow and grief to th
2 CONC y soul, but I bid thee to not permit anything to interfere with the hig
2 CONC h and important duties of thy calling in the church of God. May the Spiri
2 CONC t belonging to thy calling ever be with thee. To this end I bless thee i
2 CONC n the name of the Lord Jesus. And as thou art required to instruct and te
2 CONC ach others the great principles of the divine plan, remember that all cen
2 CONC ters in Jesus Christ, the great head of the church. He has truly said, "
2 CONC I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man can come unto the Father ex
2 CONC cept by me."  Emphasize this great truth in thy teaching and the Lord wil
2 CONC l bless thee, thy mind will expand, thy tongue shall be unloosed to decla
2 CONC re the great truths of the divine plan, and from time to time they will m
2 CONC ove the souls of men for goodâ€“those who are seeking after the truth.
2 CONT 	Now I bless thee that thou mayest have proper discernment, so that whe
2 CONC n needful thou canst decide quickly between darkness and light, truth an
2 CONC d error, wrong and right, in order that thou mayest be more useful in th
2 CONC e hands of God, and bring no reproach upon His glorious cause.
2 CONT 	I accept thee, dear brother, as one of the sons of Ephraim, with whom th
2 CONC ou art properly numbered, and bless thee that thou mayest be able to se
2 CONC t an example in harmony with thy teaching; that under the influences of t
2 CONC he Divine Spirit thou mayest be able to look back over thy life, and loo
2 CONC k at thyself as thou art now, and understand where thy weak points are, a
2 CONC nd what needs to be corrected and strengthened, and what needs to be remo
2 CONC ved. I bless thee to this end. May the light of God's Spirit and His hel
2 CONC p be graciously afforded, from time to time, that thou mayest become a wo
2 CONC rkman that needeth not to be ashamed in very deed, in this office to whic
2 CONC h thou art now called, and in the discharge of thy duty, God will stand b
2 CONC y thee, and He will never forsake thee when the time of weakness and tria
2 CONC l shall come; but the peculiar conditions will sometimes arise, somewha
2 CONC t unexpected, for which I bid the to be as well prepared as possible in o
2 CONC rder that they may do thee no harm.
2 CONT 	In thy day thou shalt see many who have embraced the truth fall upon th
2 CONC e right and upon the left, because of unbelief and unfaithfulness; but th
2 CONC ou shalt also see the faithful and true drawing nearer and nearer to God
2 CONC , and thou wilt be able to recognize that in all thy effortsâ€feeble thou
2 CONC gh thou mayest feel that they are, especially at timesâ€“ that God has qu
2 CONC alified thee to bless the people and help them to draw nearer to God, an
2 CONC d so thou wilt be encouraged to press forward and accomplish the work whi
2 CONC ch has been given thee to do.
2 CONT 	Now dear brother, remain humble and continue thy work faithfully and wel
2 CONC l, for I tell thee, that if faithful, here is the work of thy life. Do no
2 CONC t think of anything else; but give thy whole life to this office and call
2 CONC ing, and the Lord will bless thee and bless many others through thy work
2 CONC , and thus great good shall come to the people of God. May the light of H
2 CONC is Spirit and its comforting influence, to encourage and bless from tim
2 CONC e to time, be granted, and I say to thee, that with a reasonable effort u
2 CONC pon thy part thou shalt overcome, and finally rest in the presence of Go
2 CONC d and Christ and loved ones in the enjoyment of celestial reward. I sea
2 CONC l these blessings upon thee in the name of thy Lord and thy Redeemer. Ame

2 CONT 
2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: 	Vida, in the name of the Lord Jesus, our loved Savior and Red
2 CONC eemer, I lay my hands upon thy head to bless thee, to bestow upon thee th
2 CONC at blessing which is understood as a Patriarchal Blessing, that under it
2 CONC s influence thou mayest be watched over and directed in thy life lines, t
2 CONC hat thou mayst be forewarned; thus being forearmed be enabled to meet th
2 CONC e vicissitudes of life and cope successfully with the influences of the a
2 CONC dversary, and remain firm in the faith that nothing may happen to destro
2 CONC y thy confidence in it, to lead the away from it, but that the influence
2 CONC s that may be thrown around thee may strengthen thee for the purposes o
2 CONC f life, and open to thy mind the riches that are found in the store hous
2 CONC e of God, that thou mayest be made better and wiser, being made better ac
2 CONC quainted with God and His laws, and the destinies that He has in store fo
2 CONC r His children; that the inspirations of His Holy Spirit may come to the
2 CONC e and quicken thy mind, increasing thy perceptive powers, and strengtheni
2 CONC ng thy memory, in thee, that the office work of the Spirit may be with th
2 CONC ee to that extent that thou mayest be brought nearer to God in consequenc
2 CONC e of the knowledge and power that is given unto thee, under the influence
2 CONC s of that Holy Spirit.
2 CONT 	Thy life lines in the past have been lain in such peculiar nature and pl
2 CONC aces that thou hast been made acquainted with the trials of this presen
2 CONC t life. Thou hast known disappointments, thou hast borne some of the tria
2 CONC ls and burdens of life; thou art sufficiently acquainted with them to und
2 CONC erstand the nature of them. And I pray that the influences of God's Hol
2 CONC y Spirit may enable thee to understand that these experiences are calcula
2 CONC ted to bring thee nearer to the Master, and qualify thee, making thee bet
2 CONC ter able to serve Him acceptably than thou wouldst have been hadst thou n
2 CONC ot have dealt with these trials and burdens. I pray God's Holy Spirit t
2 CONC o be given thee to enable thee to bear patiently still the trials that ar
2 CONC e found in life. The children of the covenant are subject to trials and b
2 CONC urdens in this present life, they are not exempt because they have made t
2 CONC he covenant with God to serve Him; but having made the covenant they ar
2 CONC e given the promises of God that He will make them strong and enable the
2 CONC m to bear, and provide an escape from every trial and every temptation, i
2 CONC f they will serve Him, and serve Him acceptably.
2 CONT 	Now daughter, I bid thee to be faithful in the discharge of the known du
2 CONC ties of life, remembering that the performing faithfully the little dutie
2 CONC s that devolved upon thee are those things that shall go to make up thy c
2 CONC haracter; make it more perfect in the sight of God, more like the charact
2 CONC er of our Lord and Savior.
2 CONT 	I pray God to enlighten thee, to instruct thee relative to thy mission i
2 CONC n life, giving thee a perfect understanding of it, that thou mayest disch
2 CONC arge the duties of thy mission acceptably before Him, and perform those d
2 CONC uties in this present life that shall entitle thee to an entrance into th
2 CONC e presence of God and His Son, to dwell with them in the world to come.
2 CONT 	There is opening before the daughters of the covenant rich fields of lab
2 CONC or, wherein they may perform such work as shall bring them into the prese
2 CONC nce of their Master, clothed upon with honor; wherein they may do such th
2 CONC ings as shall lay up for them treasures in Heaven, where they shall be se
2 CONC cured for them as a reward in the great day when the Master shall give t
2 CONC o ? That that is theirs by reason of faithful service. The work which i
2 CONC s opening and widening and presenting itself now to the children of God i
2 CONC s of that character that thou mayest make to thyself a name among the chi
2 CONC ldren of God which shall be fore thy good, and shall reflect honor upon t
2 CONC he Master by reason of its character, and shall bring to thee a grand rew
2 CONC ard. I pray that he will quicken thy intellect, making it stronger, tha
2 CONC t thou mayst be enabled to perform the work that is now opening to thee
2 CONC , acceptably to thyself and to the Lord Jesus Christ. And that He may giv
2 CONC e thee health of body, and strength to perform the duties of life accepta
2 CONC bly, also; that he may preserve thee from sickness and from accident, tha
2 CONC t He may surround thee with the things that go to make up the comforts o
2 CONC f this present life, that thou mayest not be worried nor troubled, nor fe
2 CONC el the burden of life to the extent that it will hinder thee from enterin
2 CONC g in upon doing that work that brings to thee so much satisfaction.
2 CONT 	I bid thee to remember, in the events of life, those seasons when unde
2 CONC r distress, and feeling weak and burdened and depressed, the influences o
2 CONC f the Holy Spirit have come to thee to give thee relief, and to bring t
2 CONC o thee the health and strength necessary to thee, to perform thy duties a
2 CONC s a wife, a companion, and a mother, and rejoice in that God has been wit
2 CONC h thee, in Spirit, and brought thee relief, at times when it was necessar
2 CONC y; manifested to thee, by the evidences of His Spirit, recognition, and g
2 CONC iven thee strength to still continue in the labors of life. Remembering t
2 CONC hese events, thy will increase thy confidence in the faith, and enable th
2 CONC ee to see the events of life with more faith and confidence in Him, to en
2 CONC ter in, with new zeal and zest, to the work of life.
2 CONT 	Perform thy domestic duties, that devolve upon thee, with an eye singl
2 CONC e to the glory of God, caring for the little ones that He has given thee
2 CONC ; teaching them the principles of light, of life, and truth, forming thei
2 CONC r characters, and making their natures and dispositions so that they ma
2 CONC y represent the principles of life, and reflect the character of the Lor
2 CONC d Jesus Christ, and become beautiful men and women in the Lord Jesus, rep
2 CONC resenting the life work that has been thine, in that direction.
2 CONT 	Do not be discouraged. Never think that thy life has been a failure. D
2 CONC o the things that come to thy hand and trust in God; and He will bless th
2 CONC ee, and He will lead thee as by the right hand. He will give thee of th
2 CONC e influences of His Spirit. Thou shalt feel it thrilling thy heart, and t
2 CONC hy whole being with joy and comfort, and thou shalt be led of Him, and fe
2 CONC el His leadings, and realize that He is leading thee, that He is recogniz
2 CONC ing thee as a child dear to Him.
2 CONT 	And now I bless thee as a father would bless a child, asking God's choic
2 CONC est blessings to come down and rest upon thee, to surround thee with th
2 CONC e influences of protection and loving care, and of those blessed influenc
2 CONC es that shall enable thee to feel that thou art indeed a child of god. Th

2 CONC d in the prophetic line. I bless thee, too, that thou mayest exercise th
2 CONC e gifts that belongeth to thee by inheritance, that thou mayest be fille
2 CONC d with the influences of the Spirit of God, receive its light and instruc
2 CONC tion, and spirit ? Under its influences the words that shall be reveale

2 CONC t may hear thee, that it may evidence that thou art one indeed worthy o
2 CONC f God, to received o f His Holy Spirit. The prophetic gift belongeth to t
2 CONC hee, and thou art entitled to exercise this gift. And I pray God that i
2 CONC t may be given thee, and that thou gayest received its influences, that i
2 CONC t may enable thee to perform a good work, and that thy words may bring co
2 CONC mfort and consolation, and that thou, too, gayest received light and info
2 CONC rmation to help thee, by reason of the gift. I pray that God may open th

2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: 	Vida, in the name of the Lord Jesus, our loved Savior and Red
2 CONC eemer, I lay my hands upon thy head to bless thee, to bestow upon thee th
2 CONC at blessing which is understood as a Patriarchal Blessing, that under it
2 CONC s influence thou mayest be watched over and directed in thy life lines, t
2 CONC hat thou mayst be forewarned; thus being forearmed be enabled to meet th
2 CONC e vicissitudes of life and cope successfully with the influences of the a
2 CONC dversary, and remain firm in the faith that nothing may happen to destro
2 CONC y thy confidence in it, to lead the away from it, but that the influence
2 CONC s that may be thrown around thee may strengthen thee for the purposes o
2 CONC f life, and open to thy mind the riches that are found in the store hous
2 CONC e of God, that thou mayest be made better and wiser, being made better ac
2 CONC quainted with God and His laws, and the destinies that He has in store fo
2 CONC r His children; that the inspirations of His Holy Spirit may come to the
2 CONC e and quicken thy mind, increasing thy perceptive powers, and strengtheni
2 CONC ng thy memory, in thee, that the office work of the Spirit may be with th
2 CONC ee to that extent that thou mayest be brought nearer to God in consequenc
2 CONC e of the knowledge and power that is given unto thee, under the influence
2 CONC s of that Holy Spirit.
2 CONT 	Thy life lines in the past have been lain in such peculiar nature and pl
2 CONC aces that thou hast been made acquainted with the trials of this presen
2 CONC t life. Thou hast known disappointments, thou hast borne some of the tria
2 CONC ls and burdens of life; thou art sufficiently acquainted with them to und
2 CONC erstand the nature of them. And I pray that the influences of God's Hol
2 CONC y Spirit may enable thee to understand that these experiences are calcula
2 CONC ted to bring thee nearer to the Master, and qualify thee, making thee bet
2 CONC ter able to serve Him acceptably than thou wouldst have been hadst thou n
2 CONC ot have dealt with these trials and burdens. I pray God's Holy Spirit t
2 CONC o be given thee to enable thee to bear patiently still the trials that ar
2 CONC e found in life. The children of the covenant are subject to trials and b
2 CONC urdens in this present life, they are not exempt because they have made t
2 CONC he covenant with God to serve Him; but having made the covenant they ar
2 CONC e given the promises of God that He will make them strong and enable the
2 CONC m to bear, and provide an escape from every trial and every temptation, i
2 CONC f they will serve Him, and serve Him acceptably.
2 CONT 	Now daughter, I bid thee to be faithful in the discharge of the known du
2 CONC ties of life, remembering that the performing faithfully the little dutie
2 CONC s that devolved upon thee are those things that shall go to make up thy c
2 CONC haracter; make it more perfect in the sight of God, more like the charact
2 CONC er of our Lord and Savior.
2 CONT 	I pray God to enlighten thee, to instruct thee relative to thy mission i
2 CONC n life, giving thee a perfect understanding of it, that thou mayest disch
2 CONC arge the duties of thy mission acceptably before Him, and perform those d
2 CONC uties in this present life that shall entitle thee to an entrance into th
2 CONC e presence of God and His Son, to dwell with them in the world to come.
2 CONT 	There is opening before the daughters of the covenant rich fields of lab
2 CONC or, wherein they may perform such work as shall bring them into the prese
2 CONC nce of their Master, clothed upon with honor; wherein they may do such th
2 CONC ings as shall lay up for them treasures in Heaven, where they shall be se
2 CONC cured for them as a reward in the great day when the Master shall give t
2 CONC o ? That that is theirs by reason of faithful service. The work which i
2 CONC s opening and widening and presenting itself now to the children of God i
2 CONC s of that character that thou mayest make to thyself a name among the chi
2 CONC ldren of God which shall be fore thy good, and shall reflect honor upon t
2 CONC he Master by reason of its character, and shall bring to thee a grand rew
2 CONC ard. I pray that he will quicken thy intellect, making it stronger, tha
2 CONC t thou mayst be enabled to perform the work that is now opening to thee
2 CONC , acceptably to thyself and to the Lord Jesus Christ. And that He may giv
2 CONC e thee health of body, and strength to perform the duties of life accepta
2 CONC bly, also; that he may preserve thee from sickness and from accident, tha
2 CONC t He may surround thee with the things that go to make up the comforts o
2 CONC f this present life, that thou mayest not be worried nor troubled, nor fe
2 CONC el the burden of life to the extent that it will hinder thee from enterin
2 CONC g in upon doing that work that brings to thee so much satisfaction.
2 CONT 	I bid thee to remember, in the events of life, those seasons when unde
2 CONC r distress, and feeling weak and burdened and depressed, the influences o
2 CONC f the Holy Spirit have come to thee to give thee relief, and to bring t
2 CONC o thee the health and strength necessary to thee, to perform thy duties a
2 CONC s a wife, a companion, and a mother, and rejoice in that God has been wit
2 CONC h thee, in Spirit, and brought thee relief, at times when it was necessar
2 CONC y; manifested to thee, by the evidences of His Spirit, recognition, and g
2 CONC iven thee strength to still continue in the labors of life. Remembering t
2 CONC hese events, thy will increase thy confidence in the faith, and enable th
2 CONC ee to see the events of life with more faith and confidence in Him, to en

2 CONC y represent the principles of life, and reflect the character of the Lor
2 CONC d Jesus Christ, and become beautiful men and women in the Lord Jesus, rep
2 CONC resenting the life work that has been thine, in that direction.
2 CONT 	Do not be discouraged. Never think that thy life has been a failure. D

2 CONT 
2 CONT "Darcy, as I look at the family of Don Alvin, son of Alexander, do you se
2 CONC e Marion Don? That name ought to be Don Marion
2 CONT  
2 CONT Max was only a year old when his father died. As I recall, Grandmother El
2 CONC izabeth Agnes Kendall helped take care of this family. My mother had a le
2 CONC tter from Don Alvin's wife, about the time that my sister Jeannette was b
2 CONC orn. In the old fashioned writing, she thought her name was Jeannette, s
2 CONC o she named my sister after her. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Genie Graham can probably tell us for sure on the name Don Marion, bu
2 CONC t I am sure it was a mistake on Audentia's part putting it in the book a
2 CONC s Marion Don. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Don Alvin died in 1901, when his little children were so young. Their mot
2 CONC her worked in the book bindery for the herald in Lamoni and Grandma Lizzi
2 CONC e watched the children. Lizzie died in 1918. She also had care of Arthu
2 CONC r Marion's first family after his first wife died in child birth in 1816
2 CONC , Lizzie also took on that family. I think she wore out because she die
2 CONC d in 1819 poor thing.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Lizzie was already caring for Eva Grace's son, after Eva died in child bi
2 CONC rth...
2 CONT that is Judi Madison's line.

2 CONT 	Don, it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that I lay my hands upo
2 CONC n thy head granting thy request; that thou mayest receive thy blessing, k
2 CONC nown in the Church as the patriarchal blessing, that its influence may b
2 CONC e with thee while thou shalt remain, and by reason of then thou shall rec
2 CONC eive comfort and peace of mind. And that thou mayest thus be blessed I be
2 CONC ar thee in prayer and supplication to the throne of God, as in the dutie
2 CONC s that have been imposed upon me I am made to stand between the covenan
2 CONC t children of God and the throne of God in order to bless those who mak
2 CONC e covenant with God to keep His commandments.
2 CONT 	And in thus bearing thee before my Heavenly Father I plead for thee, ask
2 CONC ing, O our Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus wilt thou let t
2 CONC he influences of thy Holy Spirit come to bless this thy child who is so s
2 CONC tricken and suffering, and if it can be within the jurisdiction of thy di
2 CONC vine will and decree grant that he may receive such strength of body as s
2 CONC hall enable him to bear patiently the pains that may be necessary for hi
2 CONC m to pass through, if it be, and can be thy divine will, place thy hand a
2 CONC s it were beneath him and sustain and maintain him while he shall yet rem
2 CONC ain in this life, and if it can be that he should be spared to us, may th
2 CONC e influences of thy Spirit be with him to make him well and strong, and t
2 CONC o enable him yet to be useful to his day and generation, to those among w
2 CONC hom he may move, that he may have an influence for good upon them; that b
2 CONC y the influences of thy Holy Spirit he may be drawn nearer and nearer t
2 CONC o thee, that the experiences of life may be of such a nature as shall wi
2 CONC n him, in thy favor, a place that he may stand with the noble ones that h
2 CONC ave borne testimony of the Lord Jesus in the past, and have gone beyond t
2 CONC he veil.
2 CONT 	I realize, dear Father, that the condition is such that it is pleading w
2 CONC ith thee with the evidence against him, and yet I plead that he may be bl
2 CONC essed of thee, that thy Holy Spirit may come to him and bring him comfor
2 CONC t of heart and strength of mind. Keep him as it were in the hollow of th
2 CONC y hand. Remember the holy promises which thou has made to his progenitors
2 CONC , and as his recognition is of the house of Israel and of the seed of Eph
2 CONC raim, remember him that he may receive from thee his inheritance when Isr
2 CONC ael shall be summoned to received, when the Lord Jesus shall gather toget
2 CONC her those that are His and dwell with them upon this earth in its renewe
2 CONC d and cleansed condition, when He shall come to establish Himself as Kin
2 CONC g of Kings and Lord of Lords, when He shall gather around Him Israel to a
2 CONC llot to them their inheritance agreeably to the promise thou has made t
2 CONC o Israel, thy chosen.  Oh grant that this thy servant, thy child, may fin
2 CONC d his lot and inheritance and stand in it as a representative of those th
2 CONC at may follow him as his descendants.  Father I pray that thou wilt be wi
2 CONC th this thy child, if it be that he is called to pass down through the da
2 CONC rk valley of the shadow of death, to be with him and lead him as by the r
2 CONC ight hand.  May he at times feel as it were the pressure of thy hand lead
2 CONC ing him. May he realize that whatever the result may be to him in this li
2 CONC fe, in the life to come, which is promised through Christ Jesus, he shal
2 CONC l find rest to his weary body, and shall find that joy and that peace whi
2 CONC ch is promised of thee to those that enter into the paradise of God.
2 CONT 	Righteous Father, I plead with thee that thou wilt bless him as I bles
2 CONC s him, and grant that he may feel the influences of thy Holy Spirit thril
2 CONC ling him and giving him joy and satisfaction yet in the thought that he i
2 CONC s accepted of thee as thy child.  As I bless him now for this present lif
2 CONC e, as I pray thee to bless him, Father for the life which is to come, tha
2 CONC t should he be called upon to pass the portal of death and enter into th
2 CONC e rest found in the paradise of God that he there may find those associat
2 CONC es that shall enable him to stand near thee and thy Son in the great da
2 CONC y of the gathering, when there shall come with the Lord those who have ma
2 CONC de themselves heirs of glory by reason of being obedient to His commandme
2 CONC nts.
2 CONT 	It is written that thy children must needs pass through suffering and tr
2 CONC ial to make them perfect., Father I plead with thee that thou wilt rememb
2 CONC er, as thou hast promised to give aid to thy children when they suffer, r
2 CONC emember this thy child and bless him, and lead him, lead him, if it be th
2 CONC e short time that may be allotted him, in thought, that his mind even ma
2 CONC y be so influenced that it may go out and see across the border land th
2 CONC e beauties that are represented in the life which is to come, and the hom
2 CONC e of the ransomed and the redeemed. And in viewing these things he may b
2 CONC e carried beyond the pains of the present body and life, under the influe
2 CONC nces of the Spirit, freed form the pains that rack and torment him now.
2 CONT 	To the end, Father, that his name may be found written in the Lord's boo
2 CONC k of life, I bless him as a father, asking thee to bless him and to be wi
2 CONC th him to sustain him. And grant, that though this decaying body of his m
2 CONC ay sleep and rest till the morn of the resurrection, when the trump of Go
2 CONC d shall sound the coming of the Lord Jesus that he may come forth and joi
2 CONC n the mighty host that shall meet the Lord at His coming; that he may b
2 CONC e recognized as thy child worthy to gather and assemble with the redeeme
2 CONC d and ransomed that shall meet the Lord at His coming. To this end, Right
2 CONC eous Father, I pray thee to be with him and seal upon him the promise o
2 CONC f eternal life, that promise that has been given through Christ Jesus, th
2 CONC at he may look upon this life simply as the means to attain that which i
2 CONC s promised of thee shall be given in the life to come.
2 CONT 	Now, Father, I bless him to this end, that his name may be found in lett
2 CONC ers of light, written among those who have confessed the Lord Jesus and m
2 CONC ade their calling and election sure, by being obedient to His commandment
2 CONC s.
2 CONT 	I seal upon thee, dear brother, these blessings, asking god that He wil
2 CONC l remember the promises which He has made and bless thee as I have blesse
2 CONC d thee, in Jesus' name. Amen.

2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: Patriarchal Blessing of Joseph G. Smith by his father, Alexand
2 CONC er Hale Smith RLDS Patriarch
2 CONT Given May 6, 1900, Independence, Mo.
2 CONT 
2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: 	Joseph, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I lay my hand
2 CONC s upon thy head and confer upon thee a blessing.  A father's blessing. Th
2 CONC e blessing of the Patriarch in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ; and a
2 CONC s I do so I realize the importance of the position I hold and the importa
2 CONC nce of the blessing unto thee, and I pray God the Eternal Father that H
2 CONC e may give me of His Spirit that I may bless thee in such manner and wit
2 CONC h such words as shall give thee greater faith, greater strength of purpos
2 CONC e, and enable thee to overcome those things that are of a trying nature t
2 CONC o thee, and work out before God a work that shall be of worth in the sigh
2 CONC t of God.
2 CONT 	I pray that the influence of the divine spirit may be given to thee; tha
2 CONC t faith and strength may come to thee; and that those things that have i
2 CONC n the past troubled thee, in the shape of disease may trouble thee no mor
2 CONC e; but in the stead thereof will come health, enabling thee to perform th
2 CONC e duties that devolve upon thee as may apply to thyself and to thy employ
2 CONC er; and I pray that the influence of His Spirit may be with thee to confi
2 CONC rm thy faith and the resolution made to serve God, and to keep His comman
2 CONC dments.
2 CONT 	The Lord hath recognized the desire in thy heart to be good, and to serv
2 CONC e Him. He also recognizes the many efforts the adversary hath made to lea
2 CONC d thee astray, among the allurements and enticements of the world and wea
2 CONC kness of the flesh, and recognizing the struggles that have been with the
2 CONC e, He is willing to extend His hand of mercy and love and lead thee alon
2 CONC g the pathway of life, and lead thee in safety.
2 CONT 	The Lord has been mindful of the struggles thou hast made when thou has
2 CONC t been alone, when thoughts have crowded fast in upon thy mind, and whe
2 CONC n natural skepticism and doubt have been with thee. He knows just how har
2 CONC d it has been for thee to make up thy mind and to do right and to resis
2 CONC t the temptations that come before thee; and my dear boy, by the influenc
2 CONC e of His love He desires to lead thee onward and upward in this life.
2 CONT 	Thou art entering upon life and all life's possibilities lie before thee
2 CONC , and oh, there is a wide field opening before thee, a field of usefulnes
2 CONC s, a field of grandeur, a field of honor, wherein thou may yet make thy n
2 CONC ame honored in the world, not  among men, with the honor and glory that m
2 CONC en can bestow, but the honor which is given thee because of thy integrit
2 CONC y to God, and the effort thou shalt make to build up and establish His wo
2 CONC rk.
2 CONT 	Do not be disturbed in mind by the thoughts that have been given thee, a
2 CONC nd the enticements of the adversary. Do not allow thyself to be persuade
2 CONC d against thy better judgement, neither need thou fear that thou art no
2 CONC t called of God, for thy calling is in the work designed of God, for the
2 CONC e to accomplish in the establishment of this great latter day work, in th
2 CONC e preaching of the Gospel, in moving forward to the accomplishment of th
2 CONC e design in establishing of the work.
2 CONT 	God desires thee to make a name of renown, a mighty man in His Kingdom
2 CONC , and the prospects lie before thee that thou mayest enter in and occup
2 CONC y and make to thyself a place of honor in God's kingdom. However, my dea
2 CONC r boy, there are temptations yet laying in the way, these are trials ye
2 CONC t to be borne, it will not all be easy for thee in the struggle that lie
2 CONC s before thee; and yet there is promised to thee a great reward, there i
2 CONC s promised to thee the aid of the Spirit of God to enable thee to develo
2 CONC p into a mighty man for the moving of God's work, for the redemption of i
2 CONC on and her cause. And the influence of the Spirit shall be thine to guid
2 CONC e thee, and wherein in the past there has been doubt in thy mind, wherei
2 CONC n thou hast felt as though thou wert not worthy of this calling, this min
2 CONC istry, that He promises to bestow upon thee; the influence of the Spiri
2 CONC t has been drawing thee toward this great end, and I bid thee to be faith
2 CONC ful; be faithful to the covenant which thou has made and you shall be ble
2 CONC ssed by the influence of His Spirit. Thy mind shall be broadened and quic
2 CONC kened, thy memory shall be strengthened, thou shalt be enabled to grasp t
2 CONC he scriptures pertaining to the deep things of the Kingdom, and shall b
2 CONC e enabled to present them to thy fellow men, pleading with them to accep
2 CONC t the mercies of God, come into the fold of God and be redeemed.
2 CONT 	Oh, be thou faithful to the covenant which thou hast made, permit nothin
2 CONC g swerve thee to the right or to the left and therewith before thee hono
2 CONC r and glory; and what is better than this honor and wealth. The welcome p
2 CONC laudit, "Thou hast been a good and faithful servant, enter into my joy.
2 CONC " This is better than the praise of men, the recompense that God promise
2 CONC s for the faithful discharge of duty in wider and grander than anything m
2 CONC an can give. If thou art faithful the Spirit of God shall be given thee
2 CONC , to open thy mind, to present to thee the visions of eternity, to presen
2 CONC t to thee the truth and beauty that is in the Kingdom of God, that whic
2 CONC h is promised to be given to those that are faithful.
2 CONT 	All along the line of life His hand shall sustain thee. Thy life line sh
2 CONC all be laid in pleasant places of faithful. It shall be given thee, it i
2 CONC s true, little by little, as He has promised, line upon line, and precep
2 CONC t upon precept, but if faithful thou shalt be permitted to grow and excel
2 CONC , and if faithful thou shalt be permitted to counsel in the Kingdom of Go
2 CONC d in the things pertaining to life and glory.
2 CONT 	My dear boy, remember that from Him cometh all strength, do not suffer t
2 CONC hyself to be lifted up in pride, neither think more of thyself than is ju
2 CONC st and due, and above all control thyself, learn to control thy passions
2 CONC , permit thyself not to be carried into passions that would bring result
2 CONC s that would be detrimental to thy progress, but learn to control and gov
2 CONC ern thyself, and He will lend thee as by the right hand and sustain thee
2 CONC , and enable thee to remember. He knoweth thy nature. He knows just how h
2 CONC ard it is for thee to bear many things, but He will be with thee and enab
2 CONC le thee to come off conqueror over these things–.
2 CONT 	My dear boy, I pray that God the Eternal Father may lead thee as by th
2 CONC e right hand, as he has led thy father, and thy father's father, along th
2 CONC e line of life. I pray that He may shield thee from the dangers and fro
2 CONC m the trials that have been hard for thee to bear, and makest easy for th
2 CONC ou to bear those things that thou mayest conquer and come up worthy and b
2 CONC e permitted to grasp the hands of the worthy ones that have come before
2 CONC , look them in the eye, and feel that thou hast made thyself a man of God
2 CONC , and that thou hast nothing to fear, but that thou art recognized as a s
2 CONC on of God, honored of Him, and if faithful thou shalt win these honors, a
2 CONC nd be able to stand before them ?{and} the great judge when He shall com
2 CONC e to try the quick and the dead, to give to those who have labored for Hi
2 CONC m according to their works, thou shalt be able to say to him, "Father, th
2 CONC ou made my character according to the rules which thou has given, now giv
2 CONC e me my inheritance." and He shall give thee thine inheritance, and tho
2 CONC u shalt enjoy it.
2 CONT 	Thou art of Israel, thou art of the line of Joseph who was sold into Egy
2 CONC pt. Through a long of ancestors there cometh to thee the prestige of th
2 CONC e prophetic character of a family moved upon by the presence of God's Hol
2 CONC y Spirit. I bid thee make thyself worthy. Keep thyself from the sins of t
2 CONC he world, and Eternal :Life shall be given to thee.
2 CONT 	Thy name shall be had in honor among the noble ones of the earth, and th
2 CONC ou shalt be recognized as one laboring to join the mighty among the son
2 CONC s of god. I bid thee to labor to redeem the stains that the world hath he
2 CONC aped upon thy ancestors whose name has been had for good and ill report i
2 CONC n all the world. Prove thyself one of the noble children of a noble sire
2 CONC . Let this be thy words, fired in thy heart, that nothing that thou shal
2 CONC t do shall bring reproach or stain upon the name that you bear; but prov
2 CONC e to the world That God has wrought through thy ancestors and through the
2 CONC e, that thou shalt be a redeemer, and shall be among those who shall mee
2 CONC t the Lord Jesus Christ and enjoy the time when He shall come to His King
2 CONC dom, and it shall be said to thee, if faithful, "thou hast been faithfu
2 CONC l over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many.
2 CONC "  
2 CONT Therefore e faithful and then thou shall be saved with the redeemed and r
2 CONC ansomed, and these things I seal upon thee in Jesus name, Amen.

2 CONT 	I pray that the influence of the divine spirit may be given to thee; tha

2 CONT 	The Lord has been mindful of the struggles thou hast made when thou has

2 CONT 
2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: 	Joseph, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I lay my hand
2 CONC s upon thy head and confer upon thee a blessing.  A father's blessing. Th
2 CONC e blessing of the Patriarch in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ; and a
2 CONC s I do so I realize the importance of the position I hold and the importa
2 CONC nce of the blessing unto thee, and I pray God the Eternal Father that H
2 CONC e may give me of His Spirit that I may bless thee in such manner and wit
2 CONC h such words as shall give thee greater faith, greater strength of purpos
2 CONC e, and enable thee to overcome those things that are of a trying nature t
2 CONC o thee, and work out before God a work that shall be of worth in the sigh
2 CONC t of God.
2 CONT 	I pray that the influence of the divine spirit may be given to thee; tha
2 CONC t faith and strength may come to thee; and that those things that have i
2 CONC n the past troubled thee, in the shape of disease may trouble thee no mor
2 CONC e; but in the stead thereof will come health, enabling thee to perform th
2 CONC e duties that devolve upon thee as may apply to thyself and to thy employ
2 CONC er; and I pray that the influence of His Spirit may be with thee to confi
2 CONC rm thy faith and the resolution made to serve God, and to keep His comman
2 CONC dments.
2 CONT 	The Lord hath recognized the desire in thy heart to be good, and to serv
2 CONC e Him. He also recognizes the many efforts the adversary hath made to lea
2 CONC d thee astray, among the allurements and enticements of the world and wea
2 CONC kness of the flesh, and recognizing the struggles that have been with the
2 CONC e, He is willing to extend His hand of mercy and love and lead thee alon
2 CONC g the pathway of life, and lead thee in safety.
2 CONT 	The Lord has been mindful of the struggles thou hast made when thou has
2 CONC t been alone, when thoughts have crowded fast in upon thy mind, and whe
2 CONC n natural skepticism and doubt have been with thee. He knows just how har
2 CONC d it has been for thee to make up thy mind and to do right and to resis
2 CONC t the temptations that come before thee; and my dear boy, by the influenc
2 CONC e of His love He desires to lead thee onward and upward in this life.
2 CONT 	Thou art entering upon life and all life's possibilities lie before thee
2 CONC , and oh, there is a wide field opening before thee, a field of usefulnes
2 CONC s, a field of grandeur, a field of honor, wherein thou may yet make thy n
2 CONC ame honored in the world, not  among men, with the honor and glory that m
2 CONC en can bestow, but the honor which is given thee because of thy integrit
2 CONC y to God, and the effort thou shalt make to build up and establish His wo
2 CONC rk.
2 CONT 	Do not be disturbed in mind by the thoughts that have been given thee, a
2 CONC nd the enticements of the adversary. Do not allow thyself to be persuade
2 CONC d against thy better judgement, neither need thou fear that thou art no
2 CONC t called of God, for thy calling is in the work designed of God, for the
2 CONC e to accomplish in the establishment of this great latter day work, in th
2 CONC e preaching of the Gospel, in moving forward to the accomplishment of th
2 CONC e design in establishing of the work.
2 CONT 	God desires thee to make a name of renown, a mighty man in His Kingdom
2 CONC , and the prospects lie before thee that thou mayest enter in and occup
2 CONC y and make to thyself a place of honor in God's kingdom. However, my dea
2 CONC r boy, there are temptations yet laying in the way, these are trials ye
2 CONC t to be borne, it will not all be easy for thee in the struggle that lie
2 CONC s before thee; and yet there is promised to thee a great reward, there i
2 CONC s promised to thee the aid of the Spirit of God to enable thee to develo
2 CONC p into a mighty man for the moving of God's work, for the redemption of i
2 CONC on and her cause. And the influence of the Spirit shall be thine to guid
2 CONC e thee, and wherein in the past there has been doubt in thy mind, wherei
2 CONC n thou hast felt as though thou wert not worthy of this calling, this min
2 CONC istry, that He promises to bestow upon thee; the influence of the Spiri
2 CONC t has been drawing thee toward this great end, and I bid thee to be faith
2 CONC ful; be faithful to the covenant which thou has made and you shall be ble
2 CONC ssed by the influence of His Spirit. Thy mind shall be broadened and quic
2 CONC kened, thy memory shall be strengthened, thou shalt be enabled to grasp t
2 CONC he scriptures pertaining to the deep things of the Kingdom, and shall b
2 CONC e enabled to present them to thy fellow men, pleading with them to accep
2 CONC t the mercies of God, come into the fold of God and be redeemed.
2 CONT 	Oh, be thou faithful to the covenant which thou hast made, permit nothin
2 CONC g swerve thee to the right or to the left and therewith before thee hono
2 CONC r and glory; and what is better than this honor and wealth. The welcome p
2 CONC laudit, "Thou hast been a good and faithful servant, enter into my joy.
2 CONC " This is better than the praise of men, the recompense that God promise
2 CONC s for the faithful discharge of duty in wider and grander than anything m
2 CONC an can give. If thou art faithful the Spirit of God shall be given thee
2 CONC , to open thy mind, to present to thee the visions of eternity, to presen
2 CONC t to thee the truth and beauty that is in the Kingdom of God, that whic
2 CONC h is promised to be given to those that are faithful.
2 CONT 	All along the line of life His hand shall sustain thee. Thy life line sh
2 CONC all be laid in pleasant places of faithful. It shall be given thee, it i
2 CONC s true, little by little, as He has promised, line upon line, and precep
2 CONC t upon precept, but if faithful thou shalt be permitted to grow and excel
2 CONC , and if faithful thou shalt be permitted to counsel in the Kingdom of Go
2 CONC d in the things pertaining to life and glory.
2 CONT 	My dear boy, remember that from Him cometh all strength, do not suffer t
2 CONC hyself to be lifted up in pride, neither think more of thyself than is ju
2 CONC st and due, and above all control thyself, learn to control thy passions
2 CONC , permit thyself not to be carried into passions that would bring result
2 CONC s that would be detrimental to thy progress, but learn to control and gov
2 CONC ern thyself, and He will lend thee as by the right hand and sustain thee
2 CONC , and enable thee to remember. He knoweth thy nature. He knows just how h
2 CONC ard it is for thee to bear many things, but He will be with thee and enab
2 CONC le thee to come off conqueror over these thingsâ€“.
2 CONT 	My dear boy, I pray that God the Eternal Father may lead thee as by th
2 CONC e right hand, as he has led thy father, and thy father's father, along th
2 CONC e line of life. I pray that He may shield thee from the dangers and fro
2 CONC m the trials that have been hard for thee to bear, and makest easy for th
2 CONC ou to bear those things that thou mayest conquer and come up worthy and b
2 CONC e permitted to grasp the hands of the worthy ones that have come before
2 CONC , look them in the eye, and feel that thou hast made thyself a man of God
2 CONC , and that thou hast nothing to fear, but that thou art recognized as a s
2 CONC on of God, honored of Him, and if faithful thou shalt win these honors, a
2 CONC nd be able to stand before them ?{and} the great judge when He shall com
2 CONC e to try the quick and the dead, to give to those who have labored for Hi
2 CONC m according to their works, thou shalt be able to say to him, "Father, th
2 CONC ou made my character according to the rules which thou has given, now giv
2 CONC e me my inheritance." and He shall give thee thine inheritance, and tho
2 CONC u shalt enjoy it.
2 CONT 	Thou art of Israel, thou art of the line of Joseph who was sold into Egy
2 CONC pt. Through a long of ancestors there cometh to thee the prestige of th
2 CONC e prophetic character of a family moved upon by the presence of God's Hol
2 CONC y Spirit. I bid thee make thyself worthy. Keep thyself from the sins of t
2 CONC he world, and Eternal :Life shall be given to thee.
2 CONT 	Thy name shall be had in honor among the noble ones of the earth, and th
2 CONC ou shalt be recognized as one laboring to join the mighty among the son
2 CONC s of god. I bid thee to labor to redeem the stains that the world hath he
2 CONC aped upon thy ancestors whose name has been had for good and ill report i
2 CONC n all the world. Prove thyself one of the noble children of a noble sire
2 CONC . Let this be thy words, fired in thy heart, that nothing that thou shal
2 CONC t do shall bring reproach or stain upon the name that you bear; but prov
2 CONC e to the world That God has wrought through thy ancestors and through the
2 CONC e, that thou shalt be a redeemer, and shall be among those who shall mee
2 CONC t the Lord Jesus Christ and enjoy the time when He shall come to His King
2 CONC dom, and it shall be said to thee, if faithful, "thou hast been faithfu
2 CONC l over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many."
2 CONT Therefore e faithful and then thou shall be saved with the redeemed and r
2 CONC ansomed, and these things I seal upon thee in Jesus name, Amen.

2 CONT 	The Lord has been mindful of the struggles thou hast made when thou has

2 CONT 
2 CONT "Darcy, as I look at the family of Don Alvin, son of Alexander, do you se
2 CONC e Marion Don? That name ought to be Don Marion
2 CONT  
2 CONT Max was only a year old when his father died. As I recall, Grandmother El
2 CONC izabeth Agnes Kendall helped take care of this family. My mother had a le
2 CONC tter from Don Alvin's wife, about the time that my sister Jeannette was b
2 CONC orn. In the old fashioned writing, she thought her name was Jeannette, s
2 CONC o she named my sister after her. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Genie Graham can probably tell us for sure on the name Don Marion, bu
2 CONC t I am sure it was a mistake on Audentia's part putting it in the book a
2 CONC s Marion Don. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Don Alvin died in 1901, when his little children were so young. Their mot
2 CONC her worked in the book bindery for the herald in Lamoni and Grandma Lizzi
2 CONC e watched the children. Lizzie died in 1918. She also had care of Arthu
2 CONC r Marion's first family after his first wife died in child birth in 1816
2 CONC , Lizzie also took on that family. I think she wore out because she die
2 CONC d in 1819 poor thing. Lizzie was already caring for Eva Grace's son, afte
2 CONC r Eva died in child birth...
2 CONT that is Judi Madison's line.

2 CONT given at Centralia, Kan., Sept 18, 1898
2 CONT By Alexander H. Smith-----Presiding Patriarc
2 CONC h 
2 CONT Reorganized Church of Jeux Christ of Latter Day Saints
2 CONT 
2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: 	Brother Arthur, having been called and appointed and set apar
2 CONC t to the office of Patriarch, I answer thy request by laying my hands upo
2 CONC n thee agreeably to the instruction received, that thou mayest receive th
2 CONC y Patriarchal Blessing. And as I have plead with the Father for the influ
2 CONC ences of His Holy Spirit, and sought to eliminate from my mind everythin
2 CONC g that could stand between us and the presence of those influences whic
2 CONC h in their operation may give thee comfort and consolation and renewed vi
2 CONC gor in the service of the Lord. I approach the throne of God in this ordi
2 CONC nance, asking that the influences of His Holy Spirit may be granted to th
2 CONC ee, that thy mind may be quickened and enlightened and instructed, that t
2 CONC hy memory may be made stronger and that the obligations resting upon the
2 CONC e and thy conditions in life may be answered faithfully to the Lord agree
2 CONC ably to thy covenants and recognizing that thy covenant that entitled the
2 CONC e to the office work of the Spirit, and the gifts that have been promise
2 CONC d in the gospel of the Lord Jesus. I bid thee to let thy faith be strengt
2 CONC hened, thy ? So ordered that the gifts that have been mentioned in the re
2 CONC velations of the Lord Jesus may be at thy service; that as thou shalt nee
2 CONC d them to profit withal, those spiritual gifts may be given thee that tho
2 CONC u shall be enabled to perform the duties which have been enjoined upon th
2 CONC ee by reason of thy call and ordination; that thy thoughts may be clear a
2 CONC nd vigorous, thy words forceful, the arguments which shall be presented b
2 CONC e so directed by the divine Spirit as to carry conviction to those that s
2 CONC hall hear thee when thou art called to testify in the service of thy mini
2 CONC stry.
2 CONT 	I am also aware, dear brother, that in thy life there have been those in
2 CONC fluences at work which have caused thee serious thought; sometimes doubt
2 CONC s have entered in thy mind relative to the work; and to thy calling, in i
2 CONC t; and the circumstances surrounding thee have been of such a nature as t
2 CONC o discourage and dishearten, but I bid thee to be faithful in thy servic
2 CONC e to the Lord, remembering that living before him uprightly thou art enti
2 CONC tled to His blessings and His direction. Under the trials of life thou ha
2 CONC st not always been meek and humble; but thou hast been disposed to murmur
2 CONC ; and in some sense to rebel against the providences which have surrounde
2 CONC d thee in life, and the influences that have been wrought in thy life hav
2 CONC e been of a character to bring thee nearer and nearer to the Master, real
2 CONC ly, and it has been a serious struggle with thee to keep thy faith and th
2 CONC y balance of mind, directed in the way which shall find approval before t
2 CONC he Lord.
2 CONT 	Notwithstanding the hardships and the discomforts that have come upon th
2 CONC ee, dear brother, there is in thy heart the desire to serve God; He has w
2 CONC itnessed the integrity made manifest; He has known also the mistakes in l
2 CONC ife. And in thy blessing I feel instructed to bid thee to so live that th
2 CONC ou mayest feel conscience clear and free; and live above the law and it
2 CONC s condemnation; and thou shalt be blessed of the Lord, and shall receiv
2 CONC e direction under the influences of His Holy Spirit.
2 CONT 	I bless thee and would fain lay thy life lines in pleasant places, but t
2 CONC ell thee that there will be crosses for thee to bear yet; there are trial
2 CONC s and temptations and provocations for thee in life's experiences. But i
2 CONC f thou wouldst be strong and receive the approval of the Master, be led o
2 CONC f the influences of His Holy Spirit; do that which is right. Remember th
2 CONC e failings of others, and judge in mercy along the lines of thy walk, an
2 CONC d thy relationships with others. Seek to do good. Do those things that sh
2 CONC all please the Father, and thou shalt see the lights that shall guide th
2 CONC y way in life's experience.
2 CONT 	Look back over the history and experience of thy life, seek to correct s
2 CONC o far as is possible any mistakes that have been made. Doing this thou sh
2 CONC alt find favor in the sight of God; and the blessings which he has promis
2 CONC ed to give to His children shall be open to thee.
2 CONT 	In the past thou hast not fulfilled altogether the opportunities which h
2 CONC ave presented themselves for entering in to occupy in the services of th
2 CONC e Lord; and in consequences of allowing the opportunities to pass by the
2 CONC e unoccupied thou hast lost many of the spiritual blessings which might h
2 CONC ave been thine. I bid thee to be energetic and zealous, and yet use zea
2 CONC l tempered with wisdom; and remember to so live that no reproach can be b
2 CONC rought against thee nor thy character which thou has assumed in thy coven
2 CONC ant with the Lord.
2 CONT 	Life is filled with hardships and troubles; and the children of the cove
2 CONC nant cannot escape them no more than the children of the world; however t
2 CONC hey have the promise of the Lord to aid them and give them strength to be
2 CONC ar patiently the trials of life; also the promise of the Lord that He wil
2 CONC l lead them, guide their footsteps, enlighten their minds, and give unt
2 CONC o them visions and dreams of a spiritual character that shall aid them i
2 CONC n the work of this present life. So the promises are made unto thee; an
2 CONC d these gifts and blessings promised of God through the gospel may be exe
2 CONC rcised by thee. And in thy research and study of the word of God, seekin
2 CONC g to enlighten thy mind, and to broaden thy understanding, the Lord wil
2 CONC l be with thee in Spirit; and when thou shalt study the word of God as re
2 CONC vealed, thou shalt find new light in thus opening the books, and gain inf
2 CONC ormation and instruction which shall aid thee. Do not let the influence
2 CONC s of self and selfishness interfere with the service of the Lord. Seek t
2 CONC o control thyself, bring thyself into that line of duty that shall entitl
2 CONC e thee to the assistance of the Divine Spirit of god, and thou shalt be b
2 CONC lessed of Him.
2 CONT 	Dear Brother, I feel impressed to say unto thee, recognizing that thou a
2 CONC rt of the household of Israel, in faithful in the discharge of duty, tho
2 CONC u shalt receive of the influences of the Spirit, and the assurance of th
2 CONC y reward shall be given unto thee; laying thy life lines in Ephraim, bidd
2 CONC ing thee to use the talents which God has given thee in the work of enlig
2 CONC htening the people, in the preparatory work of pushing them together, tha
2 CONC t they may be prepared for the coming of the Lord Jesus; prepared, may re
2 CONC ceive Him with joy and gladness.
2 CONT 	Now dear brother, I bid thee to look back over the history of thy life w
2 CONC herein thou canst see that thou has done wrong, and made mistakes, seek t
2 CONC o rectify those mistakes, and greater peace of mind shall come to thee; a
2 CONC nd thy latter day shall be blessed by the influences of the Spirit, and t
2 CONC hou shalt feel the assurance of think acceptance; and the Lord will ope
2 CONC n the way before thee for obtaining, richly those blessings promised to o
2 CONC ne who serves the Lord. 
2 CONT 	To the end that thou mayest be found among those that shall receive th
2 CONC e welcome plaudit of the Master, when He shall come, I bless thee, and pr
2 CONC ay God to surround thee by the influences of His Holy Spirit, and guide t
2 CONC hee in the work of life. Knowing that it will be arduous for thee I fee
2 CONC l to exhort thee, dear brother, to be faithful to thy covenant which tho
2 CONC u hast made; and when the change shall come, thou shalt be permitted to e
2 CONC nter into the peace and rest found in the Paradise of God. To the end tha
2 CONC t thy name may be added to the long line and roll of the faithful ones wh
2 CONC o have testified for Jesus. I bless thee in the name of the Lord Jesus. A
2 CONC men.

2 CONT      Coral was affectionately called Collie when she was young. Her husba
2 CONC nd
2 CONT often called her Col. He met her when she was very young and never forgot
2 CONT that she was wearing a red plaid dress on that occasion. In appearance,
2 CONT she was petite; small of frame, but strong in constitution. It is said o
2 CONC f her
2 CONT that she never had the flu, though she nursed many who did. She had brow
2 CONC n hair
2 CONT when she was young, which she wore neatly curled by a curling iron she he
2 CONC ated
2 CONT over a lamp flame. She had dark blue eyes that had a warm, friendly twink
2 CONC le in
2 CONT them. When she was roused her eyes could speak volumes more than words.
2 CONT     She had a keen sense of humor and a distinctive laugh that was infect
2 CONC ious
2 CONT to those around her. She enjoyed flowers and grew the most beautiful swee
2 CONC tpeas,
2 CONT daisies, pansies and roses. She had a beautiful plant called "bleeding he
2 CONC art"
2 CONT that grew on either side of her front door. She was active in garden clu
2 CONC b and
2 CONT was also involved in the auxilliary of Methodist women.
2 CONT     Coral was a trained pianist and her talents were well used by the
2 CONT organizations she attended, from Grange in Round Butte, Montana, to the
2 CONT Methodist Sunday School, which she attended because there was no branch o
2 CONC f her
2 CONT church (RLDS) in the area.
2 CONT      She was an exceptionally loving grandmother. Each of her grandchildr
2 CONC en,
2 CONT 15 living within a few miles of her in their growing up years, had the fe
2 CONC eling
2 CONT that they were her special favorite grandchild.
2 CONT      Coral hated controversy and had a manner of dealing with it that usu
2 CONC ally
2 CONT put an end to it in her presence. Although she was very polite, kind, and
2 CONT sociable, she didn't hesitate to speak her mind on issues about which sh
2 CONC e felt
2 CONT strongly.
2 CONT      To those of her descendants who have not had the opportunity to kno
2 CONC w her
2 CONT in person, it seems appropriate to pass on a few of her little sayings.
2 CONT      She often respond to some peculiar circumstance with, "No laughing m
2 CONC atter,
2 CONT but no matter if you laugh."  She watched the weather in her later years
2 CONT because if it turned icy it meant she was housebound. She said, "Wind a b
2 CONC lowin'
2 CONT in the East, means no good for man or beast." (often in Montana an East W
2 CONC ind
2 CONT brought a blizzard.
2 CONT      She loved to watch people and found great scope for humor in the ant
2 CONC ics of
2 CONT people while shopping. In her later years she had rheumatism and painfu
2 CONC l feel
2 CONT from bunyuns--she's say, "My dogs are barking." But she rarily complaine
2 CONC d of
2 CONT anything. She remained quite nimble until her very last days.
2 CONT      She refused to consider traveling by air. She did love to travel, an
2 CONC d took
2 CONT the train to the mid-west more than once, to visit her family there. Sh
2 CONC e loved
2 CONT to travel by bus and often made friends of fellow passengers and carrie
2 CONC d on
2 CONT correspondence with them for years afterward.
2 CONT      She believed in God and prayed a lot. She worried about her childre
2 CONC n and
2 CONT grandchildren and often commented that they had a "hard row to hoe" livin
2 CONC g in a
2 CONT different age than that in which she was reared. She was saddened when he
2 CONC r
2 CONT family members had problems but she was tolerant and kind, never giving
2 CONT unsolicited advice.
2 CONT      She was a hard worker who kept a neat, clean house, and her yard and
2 CONT flowers were her pride and joy. One time Grandpa grew his pumpkins too cl
2 CONC ose to
2 CONT her flower garden and the long tendrals grew over into her flowers. She d
2 CONC idn't
2 CONT mince words, she just took the scissors and cut off the pumpkin vines. Sh
2 CONC e and
2 CONT Grandpa had a lot of fun over it. It tickled Grandpa to tell about it a
2 CONC s if she
2 CONT had insulted her pumpkins, but he was actually bragging about Grandma's
2 CONT indominable character.
2 CONT      Both Grandma and Grandpa were products of an era of what would be
2 CONT considered deprivation, today. They struggled through the depression year
2 CONC s and
2 CONT the war years. They knew hardships, but they never thought themselves
2 CONT unfortunate. They knew tragedy, but they never lost faith in themselves
2 CONC , or in
2 CONT the hope that things would come out right--which, in the end, they usuall
2 CONC y did.
2 CONT      Gathering the names and addresses of their posterity seems like some
2 CONC thing
2 CONT they would approve of. If there was anything Coral liked most it was lett
2 CONC ers.
2 CONT She wrote many and received many--if her descendants were to establish co
2 CONC ntact
2 CONT with one another through correspondence, telephone, or visits, it would
2 CONT undoubtedly please her very much.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I had been notified that the names were ready for endowment,
2 CONT etc., and I was anxious to go and take care of these ordinances.  I was
2 CONT very anxious whether these people would accept the gospel as I know of
2 CONT the life long antagonizm had by Alexander against the LDS church. I
2 CONT fasted and prayed about it. I didn't really ask to be given any sign,
2 CONT but I did ask, in a way, didn't I? when I asked that I would know
2 CONT whether or not they were accepting of the work we were doing for them.
2 CONT         Well, it was exciting to get to the Cardston temple. I went in
2 CONT with Bea DePratu to get dressed. As I entered the dressing room a voice
2 CONT spoke audibly in my ear, "When they [meaning the DePratus) are chosen as
2 CONT witnesses, you will know they {meaning Elizabeth and Alexander} have
2 CONT accepted the gospel." 
2 CONT         No more than a minute later a sister came up to Bea and told her
2 CONT she they wanted her and her husband to be witnesses for that session.
2 CONT You can imagine how this struck me! I burst into tears and blubbered
2 CONT about what had happened. The sister there, a Sister Ririe was most kind
2 CONT and of course, she later told this story to her brother, and I several
2 CONT years later received her written account of this experience from her
2 CONT point of view.
2 CONT 
2 CONT         In the first session I took the name of my grandmother, Coral
2 CONT Cecil Rebecca Smith -- this is my mother's mother.  The session was very
2 CONT sweet, but there were no big 'events' only peace.
2 CONT         In the second session I took the name of Eva Grace Smith who had
2 CONT died in childbirth when she was very young--she was my grandmother's
2 CONT older sister.  I didn't know much about her at that point only that she
2 CONT had died in childbirth and Elizabeth had traveled across the country by
2 CONT train to take the baby home to Missouri to take care of him and that my
2 CONT grandmother had tended him most of his young life.  My grandmother had
2 CONT told me that much.
2 CONT         As we were sitting there waiting to go through the veil, I
2 CONT suddenly heard, again, quite audibly in my inner ear, an excited woman's
2 CONT voice saying, "OH COLLIE!" 
2 CONT        
2 CONT         The interesting thing about this is I had known Collie was my
2 CONT grandmother's nick name in her family as a girl. But nobody ever called
2 CONT her that. In fact, I had forgotten I even knew it until I heard this
2 CONT excited exclamation.  I knew without any doubt that Grandma and her
2 CONT sister Eva Grace were there.
2 CONT         This experience was a second witness that day that these family
2 CONT members were there and were accepting and thrilled about the ordinances
2 CONT we were doing for them.
2 CONT 
2 CONT         I'm so glad for this experience. It has encouraged me through
2 CONT the years to be confident regarding the change of heart taking place in
2 CONT these family members once they were taught the truth in the Spirit
2 CONT world.
2 CONT 
2 CONT         There were equally strong evidences of Spiritual kinds that lead
2 CONT me to know that Joseph III, his three wives, also accepted the ordinance
2 CONT work done for them. Knowing they have all had a change of heart has
2 CONT given me a feeling of peace about them. I know that the Lord intends to
2 CONT bring the entire family along if they will just listen.
2 CONT         The prayers given in the 23 December 2006 Birthday program by
2 CONT Elder Packer and Uriah Kennedy will surely be answered, even as my own
2 CONT prayers of years and years were answered.
2 CONT I feel that this 'rest of the story' needs to go with the Alexander
2 CONT collection.

2 CONT David C Henderson was born in Independence, MO. on a cold snowy night in
2 CONT February. Two years later his sister Elizabeth was born in the same
2 CONT hospital. When Dave was two and a half, the family moved to Maurine, MO,
2 CONT staying there six months. They returned to Jackson County, living in Lee'
2 CONC s
2 CONT Summit, and later moved to Pairie Lee Lake, where they stayed until 1957.
2 CONT That year the family sold their home on the lake, stored their household
2 CONT belongings, and took off, in gypsy style, for Florida. For a month they
2 CONT lived out of a '57 Chevy station wagon and a tiny homemade trailer.
2 CONT Arriving in Flordia, they explored the state from Fernandina Beach to Key
2 CONT west, finally settling in the Tampa Bay area, where Dave attended East Ba
2 CONC y
2 CONT High School. There he developed an interest in short wave radio, made the
2 CONT track team, and graduated 7th in his class (1965).
2 CONT 
2 CONT Dave attended the University of South Florida, where he received a Master
2 CONT of Science in Electrical Engineering. While still engaged in his studies,
2 CONT he became engaged, and 1 1/2 years later, married Lynnette Jones, charmin
2 CONC g
2 CONT her with his talent with the guitar, and his sparkling blue eyes.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Upon graduation, Dave took a position with Motorola, Inc, in Ft.

2 CONT Hobbies/Interests:	
2 CONT 
2 CONT This year I became the proud parent of a miniature long-haired dachshun
2 CONC d puppy named Scarlett.  As I am single with no children, I dote on Scarl
2 CONC ett as if she were a child, taking her to doggie daycare throughout the w
2 CONC eek while I'm at work.  In early October, I took Scarlett to an Earth Do
2 CONC g event, which is a sporting event designed specifically for dachshunds a
2 CONC nd terriers to hunt and track prey underground.	I am an avid animal love
2 CONC r and support the SPCA organization.  I also have great interest in genea
2 CONC logy and paranormal research.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Background:	
2 CONT 
2 CONT I grew up in the Blue Springs, MO area and had a happy and wonderful chil
2 CONC dhood filled with love and laughter
2 CONC .  
2 CONT 
2 CONT As a youth, I was a competitive gymnast and won two medals at the State l
2 CONC evel.  
2 CONT 
2 CONT In high school I was part of my school's drill team (pom-pom) squad and w
2 CONC on a trip to the Aloha Bowl in Hawaii to perform at half time.  What a th
2 CONC rill!
2 CONT 
2 CONT In college, I turned my attention to classical dance at The University o
2 CONC f Oklahoma, earning a Barnett Scholarship in ballet after my freshman yea
2 CONC r.  After college, I continued to study dance in New York City at the Mar
2 CONC tha Graham and Alvin Ailey Schools of dance.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I gave up a career in dance for more financially stable pursuits.  Afte
2 CONC r moving to the Dallas, Texas area in 1996, I joined the Dr Pepper /Seve
2 CONC n Up Company, which was acquired by Cadbury, the British chocolate compan
2 CONC y.  I continue to work for Cadbury to this day.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I enjoy international travel and have visited Scotland, England, Irelan
2 CONC d and most recently Portugal.  My favorite place by far, was Scotland an
2 CONC d I hope to travel back there soon.  While in Scotland I had one of thos
2 CONC e déjà-vu moments when I knew I had been there before…just not in this li
2 CONC fetime. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT After the unexpected death of my beloved father - Charles "Chuck" Trumbl
2 CONC e in 2007, I hope to get back to the Kansas City area permanently to be c
2 CONC loser to family.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I am honored to be a direct descendant of Joseph Smith Jr. & Emma Hale Sm
2 CONC ith.  The kindness and generosity of everyone in the organization never c
2 CONC eases to amaze me.

2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: Patriarchal Blessing of Heman C. Smith, Given at Lamoni, Iowa
2 CONC , June 27, 1901
2 CONT By Alexander H. Smith, Patriarch
2 CONT 
2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: Brother Heman, in laying my hands upon thy head to bless thee
2 CONC , I feel the influences of the Spirit of God, and under its influence
2 CONC s I essay to pronounce a blessing upon thee, and to ask God that He wil
2 CONC l bless thee; that by the influences of the Holy Spirit He will confirm u
2 CONC nto thee the assurance that He is well pleased with thy work, and the sac
2 CONC rifices which thou hast made, in life, for it.
2 CONT 	He had known, dear brother, the struggles that have been with thee, in t
2 CONC his great Latter Day Work; He has known, too, the sterling integrity of t
2 CONC hy heart, that when sour pressed, when thy faith hath been in the balance
2 CONC , and when thou hast struggled to keep thy faith, He has been with thee u
2 CONC nder the influences of His Spirit, has wrought in thy favor, He has broug
2 CONC ht thee through those trying scenes, those environments in thy life's his
2 CONC tory, which ?, none, know, but the Lord.  And He has borne witness to the
2 CONC e of His acceptance. He has been leading thee. And though thou hast bee
2 CONC n called upon to pass through these periods of depression, though thou ha
2 CONC st been called upon to make sacrifices, the Lord has been leading thee, a
2 CONC nd thy call ha been from Him; and He has been with thee in Spirit at time
2 CONC s, when thou hast felt unequal to the burden that has been placed upon th
2 CONC ee, when thou hast dreaded to enter in upon the work, and thou hast, real
2 CONC ly, in thy own heart and mind, shrunk from the burdens that have been wit
2 CONC h thee, and has made thee strong, and thou hast been assisted and helpe
2 CONC d beyond thine own expectations, and the influences of His Holy Spirit ha
2 CONC ve been with thee to confirm the work.
2 CONT 	Now dear brother, I bid thee to be comforted and cheered. Do not hesitat
2 CONC e to perform the duties that devolve upon thee, though thou mayest not re
2 CONC alize, in this life, the results that may satisfy thine own mind, by reas
2 CONC on of the burdens of this present work, thou shalt be given of God a rewa
2 CONC rd after all thy labor, and I bid thee to be firm in thy faith, trust i
2 CONC n God, remembering that the source of thy power and thy strength cometh f
2 CONC rom God, and that so long as thou shalt trust Him, and depend upon Him fo
2 CONC r strength, so shalt thou be upheld, and shall be given His Spirit to gui
2 CONC de and strengthen thee.
2 CONT 	The work opening before thee is of that character that thou shalt witnes
2 CONC s many great changes in the world's history, and if thou art willing an
2 CONC d ready to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves t
2 CONC o thee, entering into the openings and taking advantage of them, thou sha
2 CONC lt be blessed of God, and be endowed of Him by His Holy Spirit, richly. T
2 CONC hou shalt be enabled to perform the work placed upon thee by reason of th
2 CONC e office and calling which has been bestowed upon thee, acceptably in th
2 CONC e sight of God.
2 CONT 	There will be trials to meet, there will be the burdens of life and th
2 CONC e traumas thereof, and thou wilt be called upon to share them; but be pat
2 CONC ient remembering that thy life lines are laid in pleasant places, and mak
2 CONC e use of the powers God has given thee to make thy home and home surround
2 CONC ings one of the pleasantest places on this earth, manifesting in thy hom
2 CONC e the will of the Master, doing His will, that it may be understood tha
2 CONC t in thy presence, and thy surroundings, there will be found those that a
2 CONC re making the effort to do the will of God here, as the will of God is do
2 CONC ne in the Heavens yonder.
2 CONT 	Thou art living in the age when changes, spiritual changes as well as ph
2 CONC ysical changes in the world, are being wrought, when the spirit of th
2 CONC e ? Is to try, to test, and to turn and overturn everything that is repre
2 CONC sented among the children of men in the spiritual nature as coming from G
2 CONC od; and every work that has been claimed to have been the work of God amo
2 CONC ng men will be tried, will be tested, and only those that have been of th
2 CONC e planting of the Master will remain, and stand firm. The others will b
2 CONC e shaken and torn and disrupted.
2 CONT 	I bid thee to be firm in thy faith. Lean upon the arm of  God,. trust Hi
2 CONC m.  Seek to please Him, and thou shalt find favor with Him. Do not be dis
2 CONC mayed  by what men may say.  Do not be shaken by what man may do. Remembe
2 CONC r that thy covenant and thy work is for the Master, to please Him, to est
2 CONC ablish His Kingdom, and if thou art faithful, thou shalt stand with the n
2 CONC oble ones in His Kingdom, shoulder to shoulder with those that have passe
2 CONC d before and borne faithful testimonies to this great Latter Day Work. I
2 CONC t is the hour and age of criticism, and that which has been written and m
2 CONC ade record of as the word of God is being criticized, and the effort of m
2 CONC an is being used for the purpose of eliminating from the word of God ever
2 CONC ything that can be eliminated and removed, which represents the power an
2 CONC d miraculous works of God. The effort is being made to make everything th
2 CONC at is represented as miraculous seem as the result of nature and natura
2 CONC l law. And this is being done, in order that the faith of men may be trie
2 CONC d. Ibid thee to be firm, and thou shalt received the power of God in ric
2 CONC h endowment to enable thee to perform and do thy work in this great Latte
2 CONC r Day Work, acceptably in the sight of God. And if thou art faithful, tho
2 CONC u shalt receive power and wisdom and authority, that thou mayest be recog
2 CONC nized as a servant of God well pleasing in His sight. And those things th
2 CONC at are allotted thee for thy labor, being performed, shall bring to the
2 CONC e honor, and thy name shall receive credit, and thou shalt receive the lo
2 CONC ve of thy brethren, and those that know thee best, and understand thee be
2 CONC st, are those that will love thee best. Seek to perform the duties devolv
2 CONC ing upon thee faithfully, and to thee shall come a reward.
2 CONT 	Thou art of Israel, of Ephraim; and in Ephraim shall thy inheritance be
2 CONC , and thou shalt receive comfort and consolation from God, in the work i
2 CONC n which thou art engaged, and to thee shall come the assurance from tim
2 CONC e to time that shall satisfy thee and shall confirm thee in the work, fit
2 CONC ting thee to meet all the attacks that may be made upon it.
2 CONT 	Should the adversary seek to overthrow thee, as he will,-- and he will m
2 CONC ake use of every means possible to shake thy faith, e'en the means shal
2 CONC l be used to shake thy faith in thy brethren, in thy fellow men, and thes
2 CONC e shall have an influence upon thy faith in the work, but,-- if thou ar
2 CONC t faithful to the Lord, and keep thyself unspotted from the sins of the w
2 CONC orld thou shalt pass through, and these influences shall have no seriou
2 CONC s effect upon thee, and thy faith.  I bid thee, dear brother, to be encou
2 CONC raged. The outlook for the work in which thou art engaged is good. The pr
2 CONC ospects are fair. And the work will move forward with renewed vigor, an
2 CONC d thou shalt see the evidences of God's power, in the work and the rich e
2 CONC ndowments that shall be poured out upon His ministry, as He sends them ou
2 CONC t into the world, with greater power, with greater ability; and He will m

2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: Patriarchal Blessing of Heman C. Smith, Given at Lamoni, Iowa
2 CONC , June 27, 1901
2 CONT By Alexander H. Smith, Patriarch
2 CONT 
2 CONT BIOGRAPHY: Brother Heman, in laying my hands upon thy head to bless thee
2 CONC , I feel the influences of the Spirit of God, and under its influence
2 CONC s I essay to pronounce a blessing upon thee, and to ask God that He wil
2 CONC l bless thee; that by the influences of the Holy Spirit He will confirm u
2 CONC nto thee the assurance that He is well pleased with thy work, and the sac
2 CONC rifices which thou hast made, in life, for it.
2 CONT 	He had known, dear brother, the struggles that have been with thee, in t
2 CONC his great Latter Day Work; He has known, too, the sterling integrity of t
2 CONC hy heart, that when sour pressed, when thy faith hath been in the balance
2 CONC , and when thou hast struggled to keep thy faith, He has been with thee u
2 CONC nder the influences of His Spirit, has wrought in thy favor, He has broug
2 CONC ht thee through those trying scenes, those environments in thy life's his
2 CONC tory, which ?, none, know, but the Lord.  And He has borne witness to the
2 CONC e of His acceptance. He has been leading thee. And though thou hast bee
2 CONC n called upon to pass through these periods of depression, though thou ha
2 CONC st been called upon to make sacrifices, the Lord has been leading thee, a
2 CONC nd thy call ha been from Him; and He has been with thee in Spirit at time
2 CONC s, when thou hast felt unequal to the burden that has been placed upon th
2 CONC ee, when thou hast dreaded to enter in upon the work, and thou hast, real
2 CONC ly, in thy own heart and mind, shrunk from the burdens that have been wit
2 CONC h thee, and has made thee strong, and thou hast been assisted and helpe
2 CONC d beyond thine own expectations, and the influences of His Holy Spirit ha
2 CONC ve been with thee to confirm the work.
2 CONT 	Now dear brother, I bid thee to be comforted and cheered. Do not hesitat
2 CONC e to perform the duties that devolve upon thee, though thou mayest not re
2 CONC alize, in this life, the results that may satisfy thine own mind, by reas
2 CONC on of the burdens of this present work, thou shalt be given of God a rewa
2 CONC rd after all thy labor, and I bid thee to be firm in thy faith, trust i
2 CONC n God, remembering that the source of thy power and thy strength cometh f
2 CONC rom God, and that so long as thou shalt trust Him, and depend upon Him fo
2 CONC r strength, so shalt thou be upheld, and shall be given His Spirit to gui
2 CONC de and strengthen thee.
2 CONT 	The work opening before thee is of that character that thou shalt witnes
2 CONC s many great changes in the world's history, and if thou art willing an
2 CONC d ready to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves t
2 CONC o thee, entering into the openings and taking advantage of them, thou sha
2 CONC lt be blessed of God, and be endowed of Him by His Holy Spirit, richly. T
2 CONC hou shalt be enabled to perform the work placed upon thee by reason of th
2 CONC e office and calling which has been bestowed upon thee, acceptably in th
2 CONC e sight of God.
2 CONT 	There will be trials to meet, there will be the burdens of life and th
2 CONC e traumas thereof, and thou wilt be called upon to share them; but be pat
2 CONC ient remembering that thy life lines are laid in pleasant places, and mak
2 CONC e use of the powers God has given thee to make thy home and home surround
2 CONC ings one of the pleasantest places on this earth, manifesting in thy hom
2 CONC e the will of the Master, doing His will, that it may be understood tha
2 CONC t in thy presence, and thy surroundings, there will be found those that a
2 CONC re making the effort to do the will of God here, as the will of God is do
2 CONC ne in the Heavens yonder.
2 CONT 	Thou art living in the age when changes, spiritual changes as well as ph
2 CONC ysical changes in the world, are being wrought, when the spirit of th
2 CONC e ? Is to try, to test, and to turn and overturn everything that is repre
2 CONC sented among the children of men in the spiritual nature as coming from G
2 CONC od; and every work that has been claimed to have been the work of God amo
2 CONC ng men will be tried, will be tested, and only those that have been of th
2 CONC e planting of the Master will remain, and stand firm. The others will b
2 CONC e shaken and torn and disrupted.
2 CONT 	I bid thee to be firm in thy faith. Lean upon the arm of  God,. trust Hi
2 CONC m.  Seek to please Him, and thou shalt find favor with Him. Do not be dis
2 CONC mayed  by what men may say.  Do not be shaken by what man may do. Remembe
2 CONC r that thy covenant and thy work is for the Master, to please Him, to est
2 CONC ablish His Kingdom, and if thou art faithful, thou shalt stand with the n
2 CONC oble ones in His Kingdom, shoulder to shoulder with those that have passe
2 CONC d before and borne faithful testimonies to this great Latter Day Work. I
2 CONC t is the hour and age of criticism, and that which has been written and m
2 CONC ade record of as the word of God is being criticized, and the effort of m
2 CONC an is being used for the purpose of eliminating from the word of God ever
2 CONC ything that can be eliminated and removed, which represents the power an
2 CONC d miraculous works of God. The effort is being made to make everything th
2 CONC at is represented as miraculous seem as the result of nature and natura
2 CONC l law. And this is being done, in order that the faith of men may be trie
2 CONC d. Ibid thee to be firm, and thou shalt received the power of God in ric
2 CONC h endowment to enable thee to perform and do thy work in this great Latte
2 CONC r Day Work, acceptably in the sight of God. And if thou art faithful, tho
2 CONC u shalt receive power and wisdom and authority, that thou mayest be recog
2 CONC nized as a servant of God well pleasing in His sight. And those things th
2 CONC at are allotted thee for thy labor, being performed, shall bring to the
2 CONC e honor, and thy name shall receive credit, and thou shalt receive the lo
2 CONC ve of thy brethren, and those that know thee best, and understand thee be
2 CONC st, are those that will love thee best. Seek to perform the duties devolv
2 CONC ing upon thee faithfully, and to thee shall come a reward.
2 CONT 	Thou art of Israel, of Ephraim; and in Ephraim shall thy inheritance be
2 CONC , and thou shalt receive comfort and consolation from God, in the work i
2 CONC n which thou art engaged, and to thee shall come the assurance from tim
2 CONC e to time that shall satisfy thee and shall confirm thee in the work, fit
2 CONC ting thee to meet all the attacks that may be made upon it.
2 CONT 	Should the adversary seek to overthrow thee, as he will,-- and he will m
2 CONC ake use of every means possible to shake thy faith, e'en the means shal
2 CONC l be used to shake thy faith in thy brethren, in thy fellow men, and thes
2 CONC e shall have an influence upon thy faith in the work, but,-- if thou ar
2 CONC t faithful to the Lord, and keep thyself unspotted from the sins of the w
2 CONC orld thou shalt pass through, and these influences shall have no seriou
2 CONC s effect upon thee, and thy faith.  I bid thee, dear brother, to be encou
2 CONC raged. The outlook for the work in which thou art engaged is good. The pr
2 CONC ospects are fair. And the work will move forward with renewed vigor, an
2 CONC d thou shalt see the evidences of God's power, in the work and the rich e
2 CONC ndowments that shall be poured out upon His ministry, as He sends them ou
2 CONC t into the world, with greater power, with greater ability; and He will m
2 CONC ove, too, among the people, and they will become hungry, and received o
2 CONC f its influences, take hold of the work, and the work will spread more ra
2 CONC pidly than it has ever before. This will be encouraging to thee. I bid th
2 CONC ee to look forward to these things, and make use of the fulfillment of pr
2 CONC ophecy as it transpires, in the present time, in thy ministry, for the be
2 CONC nefit of others.
2 CONT 	Do good.  Be kindly affectionate to those by whom thou art surrounded, a
2 CONC lways taking advantage of every opportunity to speak words of comfort an
2 CONC d consolation to the saddened and the broken hearted; and to those that a
2 CONC re in error, who are wandering, seek them, and plead with them, and lea

2 CONC l be with thee to guide thee, to give thee wisdom, and thou shalt receiv

2 CONC ife, that is promised of the Lord Jesus Christ, and partake of the beauti

2 CONT 	I pray God's blessings to rest upon thee, and make thy latter days happ

2 CONT Family records of S.D. Gleeson, Tarro, NSW, Australia, May 1979.

2 CONT  Glenda Mavis Gleeson (Isdale).
2 CONT 	My name is Glenda Mavis Gleeson Isdale. I live in Brisbane which is th
2 CONC e capital of Queensland, Australia. I'm the sister of Dawn (Schmith) an
2 CONC d Tom Gleeson.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	I met my husband Bevin Isdale in Brisbane and was married on the 16th o
2 CONC f June 1973. We bought an old home in Brisbane and lived there until we d
2 CONC ecided to go on a working holiday. We rented our old home out, bought a
2 CONC n old caravan and off we went. We worked our way up the North East Coas
2 CONC t of Queensland seeing Magnetic Island, Green Island and the Great Barrie
2 CONC r Reef. We based ourselves at Port Douglas and went on trips to Cape Trib
2 CONC ulation, The Daintree (which is crocodile country) and Mossman Kuranda.
2 CONT 	We made a lot of friends in Port Douglas and stayed there for nearly a y
2 CONC ear. It was like living in paradise as the mountainous tropical rain fore
2 CONC sts rolled right down to the crystal clean blue sea. My birthday was appr
2 CONC oaching and as a surprise Bevin had organized to get me a puppy for my pr
2 CONC esent. This puppy turned out to be a Great Dane and as you can imagine h
2 CONC e grew bigger in leaps and bounds and we were very cramped in our littl
2 CONC e caravan so we decided it was time to head back home as if we stayed muc
2 CONC h longer Brutus would be able to pull the caravan back to Brisbane by him
2 CONC self. 
2 CONT 	Brutus reminded me of Scooby-Doo; he was clumsy and goofy, but we love
2 CONC d him very much, and he was treated as if he were our child. HE WAS A SOO
2 CONC K.  Once we drove to see my mum and dad who lived in the mountains at Nul
2 CONC la Nulla Creek NSW, and we took Brutus with us. My mum took me for a wal
2 CONC k along a creek to show me where there was some platypus. So I took Brutu
2 CONC s for a walk with us so he could go for a run in the paddocks. He went ah
2 CONC ead of us running and enjoying himself. Next thing he came running back a
2 CONC round the bed with the whites of his eyes showing. He was being chased b
2 CONC y about 20 cattle all bellowing crazy at him wondering what he was. He ra
2 CONC n towards mum and me, trying to hide behind us so we started running too
2 CONC , we were laughing so much we could hardly run.
2 CONT 	We ended up running to a barb wire fence and scrambling through into ano
2 CONC ther paddock, Brutus with us. The cattle bellowed for ages after that, th
2 CONC ey certainly were upset after seeing Brutus.
2 CONT 	Bevin was a plasterer and he, along with me, as his assistant, renovate
2 CONC d our old home. It as a cozy little two bedroom cottage and we were ver
2 CONC y proud of it. Our first child Samantha was born in October 1978 while w
2 CONC e lived there.
2 CONT 	We moved from there and bough a larger home in another suburb of Brisban
2 CONC e where our son Daniel was born in May 1982. Life was good. Bevin's plast
2 CONC ering business was going well but most of the jobs he had were on the Gol
2 CONC d Coast and he spent a lot of time traveling to and from work. So we deci
2 CONC ded to sell the house and move onto 25 acres near the Tamorine Mountain
2 CONC s in the Gold Coast hinterland. It was a beautiful place to live and rais
2 CONC e children. We had a cow and chickens, and three horses; of course we sti
2 CONC ll had Brutus.
2 CONT 	I fell pregnant with our third child and we were all very excited of hav
2 CONC ing a new addition to our happy family. Sadly Bevin was killed in a car a
2 CONC ccident on 16 December 1983. Our daughter Bridey was born in April 1984
2 CONC ; she was a blessing for us as we were all struggling to cope with the lo
2 CONC ss of Bevin. Losing him left a big gap in Samantha, Daniel and my life.
2 CONT 	I sold the property and bought a home on the north side of Brisbane to r
2 CONC aise my children as it was too far out of town to be on my own with thre
2 CONC e children.
2 CONT 	Needless to say we all survived as life was very tough. Samantha is marr
2 CONC ied to Shane and has two sons, Tyler and Kaiden. Daniel lives with his pa
2 CONC rtner Tarron and they have a daughter, Keeley-rae. And Bridey married Be
2 CONC n last April.
2 CONT 	They have all grown up to be adults that I am proud to know and say the
2 CONC y are my children. We are a very close knit family and get together for d
2 CONC inner and bar-be-ques regularly.

2 CONT "Darcy, as I look at the family of Don Alvin, son of Alexander, do you se
2 CONC e Marion Don? That name ought to be Don Marion
2 CONT  
2 CONT Max was only a year old when his father died. As I recall, Grandmother El
2 CONC izabeth Agnes Kendall helped take care of this family. My mother had a le
2 CONC tter from Don Alvin's wife, about the time that my sister Jeannette was b
2 CONC orn. In the old fashioned writing, she thought her name was Jeannette, s
2 CONC o she named my sister after her. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Genie Graham can probably tell us for sure on the name Don Marion, bu
2 CONC t I am sure it was a mistake on Audentia's part putting it in the book a
2 CONC s Marion Don. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Don Alvin died in 1901, when his little children were so young. Their mot
2 CONC her worked in the book bindery for the herald in Lamoni and Grandma Lizzi
2 CONC e watched the children. Lizzie died in 1918. She also had care of Arthu
2 CONC r Marion's first family after his first wife died in child birth in 1816
2 CONC , Lizzie also took on that family. I think she wore out because she die
2 CONC d in 1819 poor thing. Lizzie was already caring for Eva Grace's son, afte
2 CONC r Eva died in child birth...
2 CONT that is Judi Madison's line.

2 CONT Rosalee Smith Elser, 81, passed away July 4, 2007, at the Rosewood Healt
2 CONC h Center in Independence, Missouri. She was born in Independence on Septe
2 CONC mber 4, 1925, the first of three children to Rosamond Bunnell Smith, an a
2 CONC ccomplished pianist and elocutionist, and William Wallace Smith, later t
2 CONC o become the president of the Community of Christ (formerly Reorganized C
2 CONC hurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints). In 1931 her parents moved t
2 CONC o St. Joseph, Missouri. There she attended school until her senior year o
2 CONC f high school. It was also in St. Joseph that Rosalee began taking pian
2 CONC o lessons and became a gifted student of the well-known music teacher, Be
2 CONC rnice Mitchell. During these years Rosalee performed frequently at recita
2 CONC ls, accompanied school musical groups and played for church services. He
2 CONC r family moved to Portland, Oregon in 1943 where she graduated from Washi
2 CONC ngton High School. This was during the time of the Second World War and f
2 CONC ollowing graduation Rosalee wanted to help in the war effort. For a yea
2 CONC r she worked as a production welder at Oregon Shipyard, helping to buil
2 CONC d Liberty ships. She then enrolled in Willamette University in Salem, Ore
2 CONC gon. There she continued her musical studies, writing the freshman clas
2 CONC s song for their spring musical. Her second year was spent at Graceland C
2 CONC ollege where she received her A.A. degree. She then returned to Portlan
2 CONC d where she worked as a private secretary for several years. At the age o
2 CONC f 47, Rosalee matriculated in the University of Missouri at Kansas City
2 CONC , receiving her B.A. in liberal arts and music theory in 1974. Rosalee wa
2 CONC s married to Dr. Otto H. Elser at the Stone Church in Independence, Misso
2 CONC uri, on June 6, 1953 by her uncle, President Israel A. Smith of the Commu
2 CONC nity of Christ. They have both been involved in the activities of Stone C
2 CONC hurch for most of their married lives, Otto serving at times as assistan
2 CONC t pastor and Rosalee as a long-time organist and accompanist. In 1990 sh
2 CONC e was ordained as an Elder in the Community of Christ by her brother, Wal
2 CONC lace B. Smith, then president of the church. Her piano skills were utiliz
2 CONC ed in many congregations from her early teen years. She later studied org
2 CONC an with Bethel Knoche and Dr. John Obetz. She was a life member of the Hy
2 CONC mn Society of the United States and Canada and participated in many of th
2 CONC e conferences held yearly in various cities in North America. Indeed, on
2 CONC e of Rosalee's most important services to the church was as a member of t
2 CONC he Hymnal Committee which produced the church's new hymnal, Hymns of th
2 CONC e Saints, in 1981. She was responsible for harmonizing and arranging man
2 CONC y of the hymns selected for this volume, still in use throughout the chur
2 CONC ch today. She also taught numerous workshops on church hymnody, reflectin
2 CONC g the interest of her great grandmother, Emma Smith, who compiled the fir
2 CONC st hymnal for the Community of Christ in the 1830's. In recent years Rosa
2 CONC lee experienced the long, slow deterioration associated with Alzheimer'
2 CONC s Disease. Gradually, the funny talented, gifted lady we all knew and lov
2 CONC ed as wife, mother, sister, and friend faded away and during her time o
2 CONC f decline we were all grateful for the loving, thoughtful and tender mini
2 CONC strations provided by the caregivers at the Groves Health Center. She lea
2 CONC ves her devoted husband Otto; two sons, Robert C. and wife Chris, James H
2 CONC .; grandson Jeffrey; brother Wallace B. Smith and wife Anne; sister-in-la
2 CONC w Ruth Harold and husband Lane; and several nieces and nephews. Private g
2 CONC raveside services will be held at Mound Grove Cemetery. A memorial servic
2 CONC e honoring Rosalee will be held at Stone Church, 1012 W. Lexington, Indep
2 CONC endence, Missouri, at 10:0 am on Saturday, July 14, 2007. Memorial contri
2 CONC butions may be made to The Groves Endowment Fund, or to the Groves Commun
2 CONC ity Hospice, 1515 W. White Oak, Independence, Missouri, 64050. Online con

2 CONT Information provided by Pamela Ann Beienburg Grandy states that Joseph Al
2 CONC ma
2 CONT McCallum married another woman by the name of Caroline.  He may have die
2 CONC d in
2 CONT Texas.
2 CONT 
2 CONT After school, he began working as an eletrician.  He fought in the Spanis
2 CONC h-American War.  He played a clarinet which "went to war" with him.  In 1
2 CONC 908 when his wife was expecting, Joseph moved his family to a homestead n
2 CONC ear Alamagordo, New Mexico while he remained in Kansas City, Missouri t
2 CONC o earn a living for the family.  However, the homestead was given up befo
2 CONC re it became "permanent" and the family moved back to Missouri.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1912 - 1913 Joseph built airplanes (like the Wright Bros.) and barnsto
2 CONC rmed them.  About 1917, two wealthy McCallum uncles funded him in a smal
2 CONC l silver mine operation in Pinos Altos and Silver City, New Mexico, so Jo
2 CONC seph and family moved from the Chicago area to New Mexico to mine for sil
2 CONC ver.  After four years and no silver had been found, they moved to Silve
2 CONC r City where Joseph opened "McCallum's Appliance Co."  From Silver City
2 CONC , he eventually moved to El Paso, Texas.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Joseph conceived and made the first toy commonly alled a "yo-yo".  He cal
2 CONC led his a "go-come".  He patented it bud didn't market it, unfortunately
2 CONC .  Robert Bruce McCallum has what is alleged to be Joseph's first model.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The fighting in the Spanish-American war was fought in this manner, accor
2 CONC ding to what has been told to Robert Bruce McCallum:  The men on each sid
2 CONC e would sleep, wake up, prepare and eat breakfast then go to the trenche
2 CONC s and start shooting one another.  This continued until darkness when the

2 CONT 
2 CONT I was born and raised in Ohio, but no, I don't live there now.  My mother
2 CONC 's family (a LARGE family) was located in southeast Ohio, near where my b
2 CONC rother still lives.  The depression forced my parents to leave Missouri i
2 CONC n 1929 to go to Des Moines to live with dad's brother.  Don Carlos was bo
2 CONC rn there.  Then they left Iowa sometime in 1930 to live near my mother'
2 CONC s family where dad worked in my Grandpa Hannah's small, "mom-and-pop" coa
2 CONC l mine for a several years, leading and caring for a blind mine pony as i
2 CONC t pulled coal cars into and out of the mine.  The work was all done by ha
2 CONC nd--no machinery.  He also delivered milk for my uncle's tiny "mom-and-po
2 CONC p" dairy.  The rest of his life he owned and operated a little gasoline s
2 CONC tation/grocery store.  Dad had lost am arm when he was only 14 years old-
2 CONC -only had stub about four inches from the shoulder.  You can see by the f
2 CONC amily records that Don Alvin, his father, died when dad was only nine yea
2 CONC rs old, leaving a family of six children, the youngest only six months ol
2 CONC d, to be raised by their mother alone at a time when there wasn't
2 CONT much way for a woman to earn a living.  She worked in a dime-store in Lam
2 CONC oni, and in the Herald House printing company while the kids pretty muc
2 CONC h took care of each other.  Each of the older three were assigned the car
2 CONC e of one of the younger three.  Dad was out alone, rabbit hunting for foo
2 CONC d for his family when his shotgun accidently discharged, nearly blowing h
2 CONC is arm off.  He had to walk with that shredded arm dangling at his side f
2 CONC or over a mile to a farmhouse to get help.  From there he was taken by wa
2 CONC gon to a doctor who completed the amputation -- his right arm -- he was r
2 CONC ight-handed.  He was lucky to have survived.  As he recovered, his mothe
2 CONC r (who btw never remarried) knowing he would need every skill he could ma
2 CONC ster to earn his way, forbid his brothers and sisters to help him with or
2 CONC dinary
2 CONT life chores.  He became ingenious in finding ways to do things independen
2 CONC tly, from continuing to hunt and fish, to repairing the engine of a car
2 CONC , to tying a perfect bow in his shoestrings; he was amazing.  During WW
2 CONC I he taught radio on the Graceland campus, substituting for a "more quali
2 CONC fied" teacher who was away in the army.  Then when that job ended he deli
2 CONC vered mail on a rural route for a while.  Returning soldiers were given p
2 CONC reference for government jobs, however, so he lost that job, too.  He wa
2 CONC s attending law school in Kansas City (actually, he car-pooled to law cla
2 CONC sses with Harry Truman) when hard times again interrupted his efforts.  H
2 CONC e was employed in the RLDS church offices, but had a major disagreement w
2 CONC ith cousin Fred M., RLDS prophet at the time, resulting in dad's being fi
2 CONC red. It's my experience that the Smiths can be absolutely immovable whe
2 CONC n they believe they are right!  My father left not only his job, but th
2 CONC e church as well, never again to return.  Growing up as his daughter, how
2 CONC ever, I found him to be the most compassionate and morally straight perso
2 CONC n I have yet to meet.  
2 CONT 
2 CONT I went to Graceland College for two years, then Akron University (Ohio) f
2 CONC or a year.  Then we got married and began our family.  My husband and I l
2 CONC ived in California while he was in the Naval Air Force; Lawrence, Kansas
2 CONC , while he attended K.U for a MSEd, and then Cincinnati, Ohio, where he t
2 CONC aught math for 27 years. We raised the kids mostly in Cincinnati.  I wen
2 CONC t back to college there, completed a BSN, and worked in emergency and cri
2 CONC tical care for seventeen years.  Now, since Ken retired a little about 1
2 CONC 1 years ago, we live in (near) Branson, Missouri.  I still work part tim
2 CONC e in Cardiac and Pulmonary Rehabilitation.  My kids are scattered aroun

2 CONT Audentia's book and Mike's database have her name as Marian Virgean Smith
2 CONC .
2 CONT 
2 CONT I was born and raised in Ohio, but no, I don't live there now.  My mother
2 CONC 's family (a LARGE family) was located in southeast Ohio, near where my b
2 CONC rother still lives.  The depression forced my parents to leave Missouri i
2 CONC n 1929 to go to Des Moines to live with dad's brother.  Don Carlos was bo
2 CONC rn there.  Then they left Iowa sometime in 1930 to live near my mother'
2 CONC s family where dad worked in my Grandpa Hannah's small, "mom-and-pop" coa
2 CONC l mine for a several years, leading and caring for a blind mine pony as i
2 CONC t pulled coal cars into and out of the mine.  The work was all done by ha
2 CONC nd--no machinery.  He also delivered milk for my uncle's tiny "mom-and-po
2 CONC p" dairy.  The rest of his life he owned and operated a little gasoline s
2 CONC tation/grocery store.  Dad had lost am arm when he was only 14 years old-
2 CONC -only had stub about four inches from the shoulder.  You can see by the f
2 CONC amily records that Don Alvin, his father, died when dad was only nine yea
2 CONC rs old, leaving a family of six children, the youngest only six months ol
2 CONC d, to be raised by their mother alone at a time when there wasn't
2 CONT much way for a woman to earn a living.  She worked in a dime-store in Lam
2 CONC oni, and in the Herald House printing company while the kids pretty muc
2 CONC h took care of each other.  Each of the older three were assigned the car
2 CONC e of one of the younger three.  Dad was out alone, rabbit hunting for foo
2 CONC d for his family when his shotgun accidently discharged, nearly blowing h
2 CONC is arm off.  He had to walk with that shredded arm dangling at his side f
2 CONC or over a mile to a farmhouse to get help.  From there he was taken by wa
2 CONC gon to a doctor who completed the amputation -- his right arm -- he was r
2 CONC ight-handed.  He was lucky to have survived.  As he recovered, his mothe
2 CONC r (who btw never remarried) knowing he would need every skill he could ma
2 CONC ster to earn his way, forbid his brothers and sisters to help him with or
2 CONC dinary
2 CONT life chores.  He became ingenious in finding ways to do things independen
2 CONC tly, from continuing to hunt and fish, to repairing the engine of a car
2 CONC , to tying a perfect bow in his shoestrings; he was amazing.  During WW
2 CONC I he taught radio on the Graceland campus, substituting for a "more quali
2 CONC fied" teacher who was away in the army.  Then when that job ended he deli
2 CONC vered mail on a rural route for a while.  Returning soldiers were given p
2 CONC reference for government jobs, however, so he lost that job, too.  He wa
2 CONC s attending law school in Kansas City (actually, he car-pooled to law cla
2 CONC sses with Harry Truman) when hard times again interrupted his efforts.  H
2 CONC e was employed in the RLDS church offices, but had a major disagreement w
2 CONC ith cousin Fred M., RLDS prophet at the time, resulting in dad's being fi
2 CONC red. It's my experience that the Smiths can be absolutely immovable whe
2 CONC n they believe they are right!  My father left not only his job, but th
2 CONC e church as well, never again to return.  Growing up as his daughter, how
2 CONC ever, I found him to be the most compassionate and morally straight perso
2 CONC n I have yet to meet.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I went to Graceland College for two years, then Akron University (Ohio) f
2 CONC or a year.  Then we got married and began our family.  My husband and I l
2 CONC ived in California while he was in the Naval Air Force; Lawrence, Kansas
2 CONC , while he attended K.U for a MSEd, and then Cincinnati, Ohio, where he t
2 CONC aught math for 27 years. We raised the kids mostly in Cincinnati.  I wen
2 CONC t back to college there, completed a BSN, and worked in emergency and cri
2 CONC tical care for seventeen years.  Now, since Ken retired a little about 1
2 CONC 1 years ago, we live in (near) Branson, Missouri.  I still work part tim
2 CONC e in Cardiac and Pulmonary Rehabilitation.  My kids are scattered aroun
2 CONC d . . . two still in
2 CONT Ohio, two in Lawrence, Kansas, and one in Las Vegas, New Mexico.CONTACT_I

1 NOTE The following is a letter to Darcy Kennedy July 7, 2005 from Gracia Norma
2 CONC ndeau Jones.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "Darcy, as I look at the family of Don Alvin, son of Alexander, do you se
2 CONC e Marion Don? That name ought to be Don Marion
2 CONT  
2 CONT Max was only a year old when his father died. As I recall, Grandmother El
2 CONC izabeth Agnes Kendall helped take care of this family. My mother had a le
2 CONC tter from Don Alvin's wife, about the time that my sister Jeannette was b
2 CONC orn. In the old fashioned writing, she thought her name was Jeannette, s
2 CONC o she named my sister after her. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Genie Graham can probably tell us for sure on the name Don Marion, bu
2 CONC t I am sure it was a mistake on Audentia's part putting it in the book a
2 CONC s Marion Don. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Don Alvin died in 1901, when his little children were so young. Their mot
2 CONC her worked in the book bindery for the herald in Lamoni and Grandma Lizzi
2 CONC e watched the children. Lizzie died in 1918. She also had care of Arthu
2 CONC r Marion's first family after his first wife died in child birth in 1816
2 CONC , Lizzie also took on that family. I think she wore out because she die
2 CONC d in 1819 poor thing.
2 CONT Lizzie was already caring for Eva Grace's son, after Eva died in child bi
2 CONC rth...

2 CONT Joyce Wynn Trumble (Robert) Rogers
2 CONT 
2 CONT 	I was born unto a loving set of parents who desired a large family. Moth
2 CONC er, Janice Bartlett Trumble was the quiet parent, more studious and reser
2 CONC ved; while Father, Walker Layton Trumble never knew a stranger. He wa
2 CONC s a born speaker, fun-loving and forever placing his family foremost, a
2 CONC s did my mother. Father and Mother were both extremely intelligent and gu
2 CONC ided the children to seek education and training throughout our childhood
2 CONC . Father regretted not completing his college education as World War II i
2 CONC nterrupted his plans. Mother did complete her college program and obtaine
2 CONC d a degree from West Virginia University in the School of Social Work i
2 CONC n 1945. This has great importance as the story beings in West Virginia i
2 CONC n 1932. Father was commissioned to the University Campus while enlisted i
2 CONC n the Air Force. It was on this campus he fell in love with his future wi
2 CONC fe. Father was soon to leave the air force branch of military and enter t
2 CONC he army division. Father saw much sadness and death in his overseas milit
2 CONC ary service that would alter return to haunt him. Much of Father's driv
2 CONC e for success, punctuality, safety, preparedness, and strength came fro
2 CONC m his very youthful service to our country. 	
2 CONT 	Upon discharge Father headed to West Virginia with his brother Robert Eu
2 CONC gene Trumble in tow to wed his lovely Janice in the very community in whi
2 CONC ch they had met. On June 1 1946, father wed his bride with his brother a
2 CONC s best man and proceeded to return to his home in Independence, Missouri
2 CONC . Thus our family begins. 
2 CONT 	Five children were born unto this marriage. I was the third child and th
2 CONC ird daughter. Mother and Father brought four girls into this world and up
2 CONC on the fifth child, received the only son to carry on the family name.
2 CONT 	I had a very normal childhood. Mother was a stay-at-home-mother until 19
2 CONC 60 when she re-entered the field of Social Work.  I was as behaved as I w
2 CONC as misbehaved. I think I as more likened to my Father's ways and personal
2 CONC ity than Mother's, although I did find my passion in the field of socia
2 CONC l work and obtained my degree from the very same institution, West Virgin
2 CONC ia University, as she.  It was there that I met Robert Lee Thompson and w
2 CONC e were wed upon my graduation on June 16, 1973.  Three children were bor
2 CONC n unto this marriage: Heather Rosalee, February 11, 1976, Elizabeth Rene
2 CONC , January 22, 1978, and Robert Patrick, September 11, 1980.  Unfortunatel
2 CONC y this marriage ended in 1984.
2 CONT 	I proceeded to raise my beautiful children as a single mom experiencin
2 CONC g many wonderful moments with the assistance and moral support of my pare
2 CONC nts. I was blessed to meet a gentleman who would love me and my children
2 CONC . On June 6, 1987, I wed Philip Steven Rogers, father of one son, Scott S
2 CONC teven Rogers, born September 11, 1973. We entered our marriage with fou
2 CONC r children. On May 1, 1988, Philip Adam Rogers joined the family, followe
2 CONC d by Kaci Joy Rogers, January 18, 1990, and Ryan Philip Rogers, January 5
2 CONC , 1992.
2 CONT 	I have been blessed throughout my life of now 57 years (as of 2009). M
2 CONC y beautiful children have all received a higher education and are product
2 CONC ive members of our society. Scott is the director of a Junior college i
2 CONC n Ohio; Heather has a business degree, but at as a mother of three is a s
2 CONC ubstitute teacher in Eastern WV. Beth obtained her masters degree in teac
2 CONC hing mathematics and is a teacher in Raleigh, North Carolina. She has thr
2 CONC ee children. Robert Patrick serves the United States as a commissioned of
2 CONC ficer with the Army and has a beautiful son. These adult children are al
2 CONC l married and happy. Philip Adam is a junior at Fairmont University at We
2 CONC st Virginia. Kaci Joy Rogers is a sophomore at West Virginia University a
2 CONC nd Ryan Philip is a junior at Robert C. Bryd High School in College Progr
2 CONC am. All the children were blessed with intelligence, a loving nature, a g
2 CONC ift to laugh and have fun and a respect for the family. We are all very c
2 CONC lose and enjoy the family gatherings. I now have seven grandchildren an
2 CONC d am told this is just the beginning
2 CONC .   
2 CONT 	As to [me] Joy: I have no particular hobbies or pastimes. I have endeavo
2 CONC red to learn and adequately master all common crafts such as sewing, gard
2 CONC ening, crafting, cooking, canning-skills of the past and present. But for
2 CONC emost I believe I have always devoted the majority of my life to my husba
2 CONC nd, my children, and my parents. I think I have always placed my family f
2 CONC irst and my career in Social Work as a means to enhance and support my fa
2 CONC mily. My children are my pride and joy. They have made very day a reaso
2 CONC n to be alive and happy.
2 CONT 	I lost my Dad several years ago. I miss him more than any one could imag
2 CONC ine. There is a part of my being that departed with his death. We struggl
2 CONC e to always follow in his teachings, to care for one another, to always l
2 CONC ook for the good and the positives in life, to take the misfortunes a
2 CONC s a lesson and to always love one another. Mother stays strong and is a w
2 CONC itness to Gods Work and earthly lessons. She continues to lead the famil
2 CONC y and mother us as the children unto her we remain. Father raised his chi
2 CONC ldren to be proud of our heritage, to remember our roots, to place the fa
2 CONC mily foremost and to rely on our Faith in God to direct us and guide us t
2 CONC hrough life's path.
2 CONT 	Thank your for including my family in the Joseph Smtih Jr., family organ
2 CONC ization.
